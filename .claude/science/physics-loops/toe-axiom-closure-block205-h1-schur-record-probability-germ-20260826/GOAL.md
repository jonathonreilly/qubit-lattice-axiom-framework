# Goal

Block 205 tests the shortest positive action-to-Record vertical slice left
after Block 204.  It must reconstruct the literal finite-source two-sector
right-Schur state on the same `C32` carrier as the fixed Block-194 PVM,
evaluate the eight effects, and pull the result through the already-derived
`M2` pointer.  It is not a periodic Berezin/CAR descent.

## Frozen primary object

Use the Block-193 full `L=24` two-sector construction at H1, mass `2/7`,
the `0..11 | 12..23` cut, ordinary transpose in the Schur half-form, the
literal forward and actual-reverse source blocks, and TT column index `1`
(the second TT direction).  Let

```text
A(e) = diag(A_in,A_out) + e [[0,B],[C,0]]
R(e) = E_N - E_P (E_P^T A(e) E_P)^-1 E_P^T A(e) E_N
H(e) = R(e)^T A(e)^-1 R(e)
G(e) = H(e) + H(e)^dagger
rho_R(e) = Tr_time G(e) / Tr G(e)
p_i(e) = Tr(rho_R(e) F_i)
```

where the eight `F_i` are exactly the Block-194 detector effects.  No source
adjoint substitution, coherence ansatz, favorable amplitude, effect rotation,
normalization fit, or changed carrier is allowed.

## Stage A: exact positive law germ

Derive, rather than assume, a nonzero real interval around `e=0` on which
the action and Schur denominators are nonsingular, `G(e)` is positive,
`Tr G(e)>0`, all eight `p_i(e)` are nonnegative, and their sum is one.
The certificate may use exact symmetry reduction, algebraic LDL/Sturm data,
or a rigorous analytic openness bound plus exact nonzero response.

The result passes the source discriminator only if the finite law is
nonconstant.  The exact inherited tangent may prove nonconstancy of the
analytic family, but a truncated tangent is not itself a state.

## Stage B: physical `M2` conditioning

For each fixed coarse port `st`, set

```text
p_st = p_(st,+) + p_(st,-)
q_(sigma|st) = p_(st,sigma) / p_st.
```

Pull the Block-194 pointer projectors back through its fixed nonidentity
unitary and prove they reproduce the same effects, weights, and conditional
states.  At least one `q_(sigma|st)` must vary with `e`.  Test the frozen
H2 held-out point and the proper-cubic/reflection orbit only after H1 passes;
the amplitude/convention may not be changed after seeing H2.

This stage may establish a physical binary pointer law conditional on the H1
source and on Record formation.  It may not call the four external port labels
one local qubit, call a pointer write autonomous formation, or infer a
permanent-history dynamics from one unitary.

## Stage C: context and axiom decision

State exactly whether `st` and the H1 source are a supplied measurement
context, a nearest-neighbor condition `eta`, or only a Fourier/action
diagnostic.  State every use of the effect-trace probability rule.  An axiom
edit is justified only if two complete same-input physical constructions
survive with inequivalent probability laws and no remaining physical
discriminator.  Mathematical POVM nonuniqueness alone does not meet that bar.

## Stop and accounting

Stop the positive claim on a singular denominator, loss of positivity,
negative atom, uniform finite family, freely chosen coherence, failed pointer
pullback, or context mismatch.  Any negative or bounded disposition must
carry the complete N1--N8 no-go-discipline audit.

No TOE percentage moves merely for a conditional H1 law.  A named local
action-to-one-shot-Record wall may be marked closed only if the same-carrier
state, eight effects, binary `M2` readout, and physical context all pass.
