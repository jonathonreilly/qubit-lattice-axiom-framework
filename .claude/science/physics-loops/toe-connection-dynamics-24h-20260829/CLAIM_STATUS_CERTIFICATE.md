Block247 derives the complete coefficient recurrence for the selected ordered
`C(I-Q)M_V` orbit on the disjoint `p0/C1` fiber. Physical conditional Haar
removes only the trivial `p0` character. Defining-vector fusion creates a
unique multiplicity-one top spin, and the supplied original-link crossing
rescales it by `r_(ell,p)^4 r_V^8`. Induction proves layer `n` has a nonzero
spin-`n` coefficient at every nonzero finite supplied crossing, so every finite
prefix has rank `n` and no finite-dimensional selected linear invariant carrier
exists. Crossing alone has a finite spectral recurrence on fixed finite
Peter--Weyl support. Primary evidence passes `31/31`, all `10/10` mutations are
rejected, and the independent Laurent-character implementation passes `7/7`.
Vocabulary lint has zero violations, strict audit lint has no errors, and the
Block247-scoped changed-evidence gate passes `1/1`, including the independent
helper. The branch-wide gate against current `origin/main` inherits four
unrelated failures across 220 checked rows; the Block247 row is ready. The
full pipeline reaches only the inherited dependency-policy epoch mismatch after
graph construction, ledger seeding, runner classification, and effective-status
computation. Independent root review and audit remain pending. No PR, push,
merge, axiom edit, primitive edit, or audit verdict has been performed.
