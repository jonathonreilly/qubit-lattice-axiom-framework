# Artifact Plan

1. Completed: immutable registration commit `61547d21fe` was pushed before
   target code or execution.
2. Completed: the primary runner checks both full-M2 affine actions, the exact
   ANF/source factorization, the actual `C32` law, and the controlled lineage
   instrument; it passes 8/8 and rejects 51/51 hostile mutations.
3. Completed: the independent checker imports no primary result flags, rebuilds
   the load-bearing objects, passes 7/7, and rejects 40/40 mutations.
4. Completed: exact full-Gram and independent reduced-`C32` perturbation bounds
   certify a common interval `abs(e)<=10^-9`.
5. Completed: both runners have successful identity-bound caches.  A fresh
   independent adversarial re-audit after the covariance repairs returned
   PASS with no remaining load-bearing blocker; formal retained audit status
   remains unset.
6. Blocked for delivery, not for science: the citation graph is refreshed and
   all local checks pass, but the full pipeline fails at stage 7 because the
   stacked base and current `origin/main` each carry a dependency-policy source
   hash that disagrees with their own governed epoch manifest.  Block 03
   changes neither surface and may not refresh auditor-owned policy state.
   The helper-runner mapping is recorded as a reviewed hard landing condition.
   Commit and push the science branch, backlog the PR, and retry conformance
   after the governance repair.  No `review-loop` is permitted.
