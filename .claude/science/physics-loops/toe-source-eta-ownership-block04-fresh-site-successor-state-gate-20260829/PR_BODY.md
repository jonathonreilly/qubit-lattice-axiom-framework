# Source/Eta Block 04: fresh-site successor-state gate

## Result

- proves exactly that an all-six-ready Record append changes the ready set by
  deleting the chosen site only;
- proves ready sites are nonadjacent, other ready masks are unchanged, and
  simultaneous updates cannot propagate a front;
- rejects the direct `x+d` successor on all 768 rows because it is already a
  permanent Record;
- enumerates 32 missing outer-shell completions per nominal tuple and 9,216
  active-start compatibility rows, none of which is a reachable event;
- supplies an exact five-neighbor counterexample, so no broader dynamics or
  axiom no-go is promoted.

## Verification

- primary: 5/5; 23/23 mutations rejected;
- independent: 4/4; 20/20 mutations rejected;
- independent graph census: 33,867 graphs, 2,131,018 states, 1,519,837 legal
  appends;
- N1-N8 broad-negative gate: FAIL and correctly demoted;
- no axiom edit, obligation retirement, retained status, or TOE movement.
