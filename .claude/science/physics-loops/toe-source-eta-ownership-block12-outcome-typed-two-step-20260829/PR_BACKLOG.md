# PR Backlog

The science result is pushed at
`4db65374c6b04b52045fc46e4b312864dc9c5f08` but its review PR is backlogged.

The current citation-graph builder attaches the primary and inherited helper
set but does not attach the new structurally independent Block-12 checker as
an exact helper.  That registry surface is governed by the dependency-policy
epoch manifest, which the full pipeline reports as inconsistent before any
Block-12-specific review step.  The author branch does not edit that audit
governance surface or manufacture a retained verdict.

Reopen when the epoch manifest is reconciled and the exact helper mapping can
be regenerated normally.  Until then the pushed branch, fresh caches, source
note, and packet are the durable review inputs.
