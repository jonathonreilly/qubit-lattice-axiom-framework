# Reuse Map

The primary imports the pinned Block-10 primary to reuse the frozen target and
law definitions, then constructs the Block-12 code, transport, and history.

The independent checker imports only the independent Block-10 reconstruction.
It does not import the Block-12 primary or the Block-09/10 primary runners.  It
rebuilds the code, hybrid carrier, exact scans, lattice dictionary, collision
falsifier, and prefix proof separately.

Shared SymPy and immutable H1/H2 point data are implementation infrastructure,
not shared Block-12 adjudication logic.
