# Goal

Source/Eta Block 13 attacks the highest-ranked boundary exposed by Block 12:
the five-cell relay is exact on an empty straight corridor but moves a
permanent Record if one occupies a radius-two SWAP destination.  This block
tests one explicit effective controller that is total on arbitrary **static
Record obstacles** around a single active straight tip.

The target is not another carrier, positivity, or probability-law campaign.
It must remove the unbounded empty-corridor condition without reading the
nonorthogonal predecessor code, moving any Record, adding a role/epoch/site
field, or changing the fourteen-way law.

## Frozen typed local state

Each site has two distinct pieces of effective state:

```text
R(z) in {0,1}: whether a permanent Record is present;
c(z) in M2:    its locked Record content when R=1, or its live condition
               content when R=0.
```

`R` is the Record-configuration predicate used by this candidate downstream
dynamics.  The minimal axioms make Record presence, uniqueness, and permanence
part of the state ontology, but do not themselves supply this controller,
transition channel, or formation-site rule.  No claim that an observer reads
the content of a no-Record site is allowed.

The Block-12 encoded Record states and hybrid carrier remain frozen:

```text
g = 9/16,
epsilon = 1/256,
r_(f,b) = -g f + epsilon s_b,
v_(-f) = r_(f,a),
v_(+f) = 2 F f + r_(f,a),
v_n    = F n for n perpendicular to f.
```

The controller may never invert `r_(f,a)` to recover either `f` or `a`.
The probability stage receives the actual six nearest-neighbor contents and
uses the unchanged Block-09 law directly.

## Oracle-free straight-tip geometry

For a no-Record candidate site `x`, a direction `f` is an eligible straight
tip exactly when:

1. `R(x-f)=R(x-2f)=1`;
2. `R(x+d)=0` for the other five nearest-neighbor directions `d != -f`;
3. no second nearest-neighbor Record competes with `x-f`.

The direction is therefore the displacement from the unique predecessor
Record at `x-f`, certified by the collinear grand-predecessor at `x-2f`.
Neither Record content is decoded.  In an isolated straight trail of length at
least two, the newest tip must be the unique no-Record candidate selected by
this test; lateral neighbors of every Record must fail the collinearity test.

This eligibility predicate is a finite-radius formation-site proposal, not
part of the nearest-neighbor probability distribution supplied by
Admissibility.  Formation occurrence, competition between several eligible
tips, rate, and physical time remain outside this block.

## Frozen all-or-none obstacle controller

Condition on formation at one eligible `x` and realized outcome `b`.  Write
the permanent Record `r_(f,b)` at `x`.  Define five source/destination pairs

```text
x+f       -> x+2f,
x+/-e_1   -> x+f+/-e_1,
x+/-e_2   -> x+f+/-e_2,
```

where `e_1,e_2` are the four signed coordinate directions perpendicular to
`f`.  Freeze the guard

```text
C(x,f) = product over destinations z of (1-R(z)).
```

The post-formation effective controller is exactly:

- `C=1`: apply all five disjoint nearest-neighbor SWAPs to the `M2` contents;
- `C=0`: apply identity to every source and destination content;
- in both branches, never alter any pre-existing Record flag or content and
  keep the newly written Record at `x` permanent.

The guard is evaluated from pre-event Record flags and is independent of the
realized outcome.  Partial transport is forbidden.  The clear branch must
reproduce the exact Block-12 successor shell.  In every blocked branch, at
least one of the five live-neighbor positions of the nominal next site `x+f`
is a Record, so that nominal continuation must fail the straight-tip
eligibility test without a terminal marker.

The effective guarded channel is allowed as a radius-two block map on the
classical Record sectors.  A finite-depth microscopic nearest-neighbor
controller/ancilla implementation is not supplied and must remain an open
bridge unless constructed here.

## Exhaustive target

The runner must cover exactly:

- all six signed-axis fronts;
- all fourteen predecessor outcomes and fourteen realized outcomes;
- all `2^5=32` destination Record-flag patterns;
- all five source/destination addresses with arbitrary symbolic no-Record
  destination contents in the clear pattern;
- every blocked pattern with arbitrary contents but immutable occupied Record
  contents;
- exact clear successor decoding, probability normalization, and outcome-law
  invariance;
- exact blocked identity, Record permanence, stable no-marker termination,
  and no probability mass loss when `STOP` is included;
- a straight-trail uniqueness test and a source scan proving that runtime
  propagation does not call the Block-12 codebook or accept `F`, predecessor
  outcome, target, role, epoch, site ID, scheduler, global time, or future
  outcome.

The registered local controller table therefore has
`6 x 14 x 14 x 32 = 37632` front/predecessor/outcome/obstacle cases.

## Prospective adjudication

Exactly one terminal must be returned:

- `SAFE-TERMINATING-CONTROLLER`: all 37632 cases use the same covariant
  content-blind geometry/guard rule; clear cases transport exactly, blocked
  cases preserve every Record and terminate without a marker, and conditional
  event probabilities remain normalized;
- `CONDITIONAL-HALO`: safety requires a supplied corridor, clearance bit,
  packet-owner tag, role/epoch field, content codebook lookup, partial SWAP,
  radius-two no-Record content read, or external scheduler;
- `NO-MEMBER`: no member of the frozen all-or-none geometry/guard family is a
  total permanence-safe effective controller.

`SAFE-TERMINATING-CONTROLLER` is an effective single-active-tip result.  It is
not a claim of simultaneous interacting-front arbitration or microscopic
quantum control.

## Hard falsifiers

- insert a Record independently at each one of the five destinations;
- insert all 31 nonempty combinations and verify no occupied Record moves;
- replace all-or-none identity by per-edge SWAP and require the mutation to
  fail on partial collisions;
- delete the collinear grand-predecessor test and require lateral branching to
  appear;
- call the exact `(f,a)` codebook or use old outcome `a` in the controller and
  require failure;
- make the guard outcome-dependent and require same-event feedback failure;
- claim that safe termination provides site selection, rate, clock,
  interacting-front arbitration, microscopic readout/control, gravity, an
  axiom amendment, obligation retirement, or TOE movement.

## Accounting

This preregistration authorizes no minimal-axiom edit.  Formal obligation
retirement and TOE percentage movement remain zero unless a later independent
audit ratifies an applicable closure.
