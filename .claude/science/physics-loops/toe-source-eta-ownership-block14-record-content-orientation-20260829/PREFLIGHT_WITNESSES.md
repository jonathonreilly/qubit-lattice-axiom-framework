# Preflight Witnesses

No Block-14 target runner, independent checker, result cache, or target
mutation was executed before this freeze.  These are analytic witnesses and
falsifiers; the post-registration runners must rederive them.

## Decoder-margin witness

For the true signed front,

```text
f^T r_(f,b) = -144/256 + (f^T s_b)/256
             <= -143/256 < -128/256.
```

For the opposite signed axis the large term is positive.  For every
perpendicular signed axis, the component lies in `[-1/256,1/256]`.  Therefore
`d^T r < -1/2` has exactly one solution, `d=f`, for every outcome.  This also
exhibits a nonzero threshold interval rather than a tuned equality.

## Covariance witness

For every proper cubic rotation `Q`,

```text
r_(Qf,Qb) = Q r_(f,b),
d^T r < -1/2  iff  (Qd)^T (Qr) < -1/2.
```

Thus `D(Qr)=Q D(r)` if uniqueness holds.  This is a coordinate-free orbit
statement even though one signed-axis chart is used in code.

## Reflection witness

Let a finite trail occupy `0,f,...,(L-1)f`, with every Record content encoding
the same signed front `f` and arbitrary outcomes.

- candidate `Lf` sees its nearest predecessor at `(L-1)f=x-f`; `D=f`, so it
  passes orientation and collinearity;
- candidate `-f` sees its nearest Record at `0=x+f`; that Record still decodes
  `f`, so the required relation `p=x-f` fails;
- lateral candidates fail predecessor displacement or collinearity.

The old outcome content is irrelevant.  The two-Record seed remains supplied
and already oriented through its contents.

## Guard-composition witness

On a clear layer, the decoded `f` selects exactly the Block-13 five disjoint
edges, so all 1,176 successor identities are inherited targets to be freshly
recomputed.  On a blocked layer, identity preserves every source,
destination, and Record.  Decoder use does not alter the fourteen-way
probability distribution or make the guard outcome-dependent.

## Whole-frontier STOP witness

After a blocked event, the only adjacent collinear Record pairs in the
registered local component belong to the oriented trail.  Older forward
candidates are already Records; the newest forward candidate has at least two
nearest Records because one of the five obstacle positions is occupied.  The
reflected endpoint fails content orientation.  Obstacle Records are pairwise
nonadjacent along a coordinate line and have no collinear grand-predecessor;
their possible decoded directions can therefore be exhausted one at a time.

This supports zero eligible sites in the registered local frontier.  It does
not exclude an unrelated eligible front elsewhere in an arbitrary global
background and must not be advertised as a lattice-wide absorbing state.

## Framework-versus-microscopic boundary

The minimal Record axiom permits readout determined by locked content, so the
fixed coarse functional is a legitimate effective-law candidate.  The axiom
does not uniquely select the threshold, derive a measurement circuit, or make
the 84 full-rank nonorthogonal one-qubit density matrices perfectly
distinguishable.  A positive result therefore advances the framework-level
history program while leaving a real microscopic pointer/control bridge.

## Portfolio witness

The Block-13 five-seat panel ranked this discriminator first by `3/5`; the
quantum-information dissent ranked an enlarged orthogonal pointer first.  All
five ranked concurrency next, rate/clock after composability, and connection/
gravity last.  PR #7799 strengthens an exact selected finite Gram but continues
to import action, temporal multipliers, crossing/`Q`, and a finite carrier, so
it does not displace this direct reflection falsifier.

## Principal risks frozen before execution

1. Exact framework content access may remain only semantic, not microscopic.
2. The oriented two-Record seed is supplied rather than generated.
3. The atomic five-site guard remains an effective radius-two block map.
4. The zero-frontier terminal is local to the registered trail/obstacle
   component, not arbitrary simultaneous fronts.
5. A fixed successful decoder is a compatible candidate law, not a proof that
   the axioms uniquely force it.

Any risk may bound interpretation.  None permits same-cycle changes to the
frozen decoder, code, controller, source law, or axioms.
