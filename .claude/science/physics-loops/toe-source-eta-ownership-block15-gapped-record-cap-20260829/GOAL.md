# Goal

Source/Eta Block 15 tests the cheapest route exposed by the Block-14
five-physicist panel.  Block 14 removes reflected growth by reading a signed
front from nonorthogonal Record content.  This block asks whether one supplied
asymmetric **gapped axial Record cap** can remove the same reflection ambiguity
using permanent Record flags alone, without reading any Record content.

This is a propagation-feasibility discriminator.  It does not claim that the
cap, its orientation, its site, or its occurrence has been generated.

## Frozen capped seed family

For each signed coordinate direction `f`, use a finite straight trail

```text
0, f, 2f, ..., (L-1)f,    L >= 2,
```

and add one permanent cap Record at `-2f`, leaving `-f` explicitly without a
Record.  The cap and trail contents may be arbitrary registered physical
Record contents.  Eligibility must read flags only.

The family is translation-relative and proper-cubic covariant:

```text
Q { -2f, 0, f, ..., (L-1)f }
= { -2Qf, 0, Qf, ..., (L-1)Qf }.
```

No public runtime input identifies the cap, gap, trail end, front, role,
epoch, or site.

## Frozen flag-only eligibility

For a no-Record candidate `x`:

1. require exactly one nearest-neighbor Record at `p`;
2. infer `f=x-p` from that displacement;
3. require a Record at `x-2f`;
4. require the other five nearest-neighbor sites to be no-Record.

This is exactly the Block-13 flag predicate, not the Block-14 content decoder.
The front passed to the post-formation stage must be the predicate's internal
output.  Runtime may not read Record content, a content codebook, cap metadata,
or a host direction.

## Frozen obstacle controller and law

Retain the Block-13 all-or-none five-cell controller and the unchanged
fourteen-way local probability law.  Conditioned on formation and outcome:

- write the unchanged outcome-typed Record at `x` using the internally inferred
  `f`;
- execute all five disjoint nearest-neighbor SWAPs exactly when every
  destination Record flag is clear;
- otherwise execute identity on every source/destination content and route all
  outcome mass to local `(b,STOP)`;
- never move a pre-existing Record, partially transport, clone, or grow the
  five-cell packet.

The cap is part of the static Record background.  It must never overlap a
source/destination or alter a clear successor.

## Exhaustive target

The primary runner must cover:

- all six fronts and all 24 proper cubic rotations of capped geometry;
- trail lengths two through seventeen;
- all 84 possible registered cap contents as a content-blindness control,
  while the public predicate receives flags only;
- the complete no-Record frontier of every capped trail, requiring exactly one
  forward candidate and rejecting the gap, cap exterior, and every lateral or
  cap-generated candidate;
- all `6 x 14 x 14 x 32 = 37,632` composed controller cases with exact clear
  successor, blocked identity/permanence, packet size five, and normalized
  continue-or-STOP mass;
- after each of the 31 nonempty obstacle patterns, all six fronts and trail
  lengths two through seventeen (`2,976` components), requiring zero eligible
  sites over the complete registered cap/trail/new-Record/obstacle frontier;
- source/AST scans excluding content reads, cap/role labels, host direction,
  site ID, scheduler, global time, target fixture, and same-event probability
  feedback.

The structurally independent checker must import neither the Block-15 primary
nor the Block-13 primary, use a different exact geometry implementation, and
test translated as well as rotated capped seeds.

## Prospective adjudication

Exactly one terminal must be returned:

- `GAPPED-CAP-SAFE-FRONT`: every supplied capped trail has exactly one forward
  tip under the flag-only predicate, cap geometry is covariant/content-blind,
  clear and blocked controller cases remain exact, and every registered blocked
  local component has zero eligible continuation;
- `BOUNDARY-ARROW-ONLY`: propagation works only by reading cap content, a cap
  role, host direction, endpoint selector, site identity, or another supplied
  runtime oracle;
- `CAP-FOOTPRINT-CONFLICT`: the cap creates a false tip, blocks legitimate
  transport, overlaps the live packet, or prevents local STOP;
- `NO-MEMBER`: no member of the fixed one-Record gapped axial cap family yields
  a unique safe front.

Even `GAPPED-CAP-SAFE-FRONT` means only that a supplied asymmetric boundary can
carry an effective arrow cheaply.  It is not cap generation, spontaneous
direction selection, microscopic flag sensing/control, simultaneous-front
confluence, site occurrence, rate/time, gravity, or TOE completion.

## Hard falsifiers

- the gap site `-f` or cap exterior `-3f` is eligible;
- any cap-generated or lateral frontier site is eligible;
- any cap content changes eligibility or the inferred front;
- the cap overlaps a source/destination or changes a clear successor;
- any registered blocked local frontier remains eligible;
- runtime reads content, a cap label, front, site, role, epoch, or scheduler;
- any occupied Record moves, partial packet executes, or STOP loses mass;
- claim a generated cap, chosen physical arrow, microscopic controller,
  interacting-front dynamics, occurrence/rate/time, gravity, an axiom update,
  obligation retirement, retained status, or TOE movement.

## Accounting

This preregistration authorizes no minimal-axiom edit.  Formal obligation
retirement and TOE percentage movement remain zero unless a later independent
audit ratifies an applicable closure.
