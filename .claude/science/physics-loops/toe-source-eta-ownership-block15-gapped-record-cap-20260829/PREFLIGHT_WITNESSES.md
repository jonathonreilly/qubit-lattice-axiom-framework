# Preflight Witnesses

No Block-15 target runner, independent checker, result cache, or target
mutation was written or executed before this freeze.  These are analytic
witnesses and falsifiers; post-registration runners must rederive them.

## Forward-tip witness

For trail length `L>=2`, candidate `Lf` has exactly one nearest Record at
`(L-1)f` and a collinear grand-predecessor at `(L-2)f`.  The cap at `-2f` is
strictly behind the trail and cannot enter the candidate's nearest-neighbor
shell.  The unchanged flag predicate therefore returns `f`.

## Gap and cap-exterior witnesses

The reflected gap candidate `-f` has two nearest Records, at `0` and `-2f`, so
it fails before a direction is inferred.  Candidate `-3f` has the cap at
`-2f` as its unique nearest Record but has no grand-predecessor at `-f`, so it
also fails.

Any lateral neighbor of the cap has the cap as a possible nearest Record but
no second Record one further step along that lateral axis.  The cap is not
nearest-neighbor adjacent to any trail Record.  Thus it does not create an
independent two-Record line or a new tip.

## Covariance and content-blindness witnesses

Proper cubic rotations preserve signed axes, adjacency, the gap, and the
relation `cap=-2f`.  Translations disappear in candidate-relative
coordinates.  Because eligibility accepts only Record flags, changing cap or
trail content cannot change the inferred front or candidate set.

This is a flag-sector statement.  It does not construct a microscopic sensor
for exact Record presence.

## Controller-disjointness witness

For the earliest legal trail `0,f` the next formation site is `x=2f`.  The
five sources are `x+f` and `x+e` for the four signed directions perpendicular
to `f`; destinations add another `f`.  The cap is at `-2f`, so it is distinct
from every source and destination.  Longer trails increase the separation.

The cap therefore cannot trigger the forward obstacle guard or alter a clear
successor.  All Block-13 controller identities remain targets to be freshly
recomputed rather than assumed.

## Blocked-frontier witness

After a blocked formation, the forward candidate has the newest trail Record
and at least one occupied destination in its nearest shell, so it fails the
unique-nearest condition.  The gap still has two nearest Records.  The cap
exterior still lacks a grand-predecessor.  Other cap/trail laterals have no
collinear Record pair; obstacle-generated candidates must be exhausted rather
than dismissed analytically.

This supports zero eligibility on the registered finite component, not a
lattice-wide absorbing state.

## Generation boundary

The capped seed explicitly supplies the ordered branch `f`.  A deterministic
nonzero direction cannot be selected covariantly from a fully symmetric local
precursor.  A successor generation campaign may instead construct a covariant
six- or 24-branch instrument and let the realized branch carry the arrow.  It
must also write the live packet and preserve all prior Records without a host
front, site, role, epoch, or tape.

Failure of that future generation target could identify a boundary-state or
past-arrow residual.  The present supplied-cap discriminator cannot decide
whether such a residual requires new axioms.

## Portfolio witness

The Block-14 five-seat panel votes unanimously that the effective content
orientation is meaningful but nonmicroscopic.  Its majority ranks generated
cap/seed first, atomic concurrency second, orthogonal pointer third, rate/time
fourth, and gravity fifth.  The supplied cap test is deliberately cheaper than
all five: it decides whether the proposed cap geometry is even compatible with
the existing history controller before investing in its generation.

PR #7787 remains a useful distributed-writer template but addresses a
different H1 decoder and supplies its precursor/wider write.  PR #7799 remains
conditional on action and temporal/projector inputs.  Neither is proof input.

## Principal risks frozen before execution

1. The cap may create a second local two-Record line elsewhere in its frontier.
2. An occupied controller destination may combine with the cap or trail into a
   new eligible tip.
3. Flag-only eligibility may still rely on exact effective Record-sector
   sensing with no microscopic implementation.
4. A positive cap merely relocates the arrow to asymmetric boundary data.
5. Generating cap, seed Records, and live packet in one covariant local
   instrument may be impossible or target-equivalent to occurrence/arrow
   selection.

Any risk may bound interpretation.  None permits a same-cycle change to the
frozen cap geometry, predicate, code, law, controller, or axioms.
