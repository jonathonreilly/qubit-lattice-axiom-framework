# Block28 execution history

## Frozen preexecution stage

The amended target source was committed at
`db1f896dbee2a6a51ca0d8f4d835d6810f29efa0`.  Three independent read-only
attacks returned `SAFE` on source SHA-256
`f1090371f20ed03b869d0ae727849496a94ff85b66d4bb02f559b3e0a30a462c`
without importing or executing the target.  Their final record was committed
at `805923bf884174a7ff212ca6bcdf3b06309d4a43`; the separate source pin was
committed at `502e8ba3a8ca6413cb154c8a6b2f982ca31c2d74`.

Immediately before launch, all `19` declared inputs existed and were unique,
all `14` frozen packet hashes and `3` direct dependency hashes matched, the
source pin matched the reviewed bytes, syntax compilation passed, and the
worktree was clean.

The emitted terminal was:

```

## Declared-timeout final reproduction

The first execution supplied the same `900`-second limit to the cache wrapper,
but the runner itself did not yet declare the required
`AUDIT_TIMEOUT_SEC = 900` constant.  Commit
`32488c1f0d2e62c0e3fec92979671b7ce1372c43` added only that inert declaration.
Three independent reviewers rebound their static attacks to the resulting
source SHA-256, and the final source pin plus attack record landed at
`1bba9e33c31c6187f53149cfa3d40119bde399fa` before reproduction.

The canonical cache was then refreshed without a command-line timeout
override:

The wrapper's subsequent `--check-only` query reported the cache `fresh`.
The terminal and all substantive check results exactly match the first run.

The run checked the literal `1,568`-branch local turn module, `196` exact
source-pair controls, the ten-atom success guards, the active projector plus
complement STOP, proper-cubic and translation covariance, two complete
supplied-`q` channels, `3,136` injective pair Record configurations, arbitrary
reference extension, and the decoded event odds `1/4` and `5/8`.

This is an author-side bounded theorem with conditional/support scope.  It is
not an execution of a repeat-use process, an autonomous invocation rule, a
nearest-neighbor microscopic compiler, a formation-rate law, a gravity join,
or a lattice-wide dynamics.  It does not authorize process-law
underselection, an axiom amendment, obligation retirement, or TOE-score
movement.
