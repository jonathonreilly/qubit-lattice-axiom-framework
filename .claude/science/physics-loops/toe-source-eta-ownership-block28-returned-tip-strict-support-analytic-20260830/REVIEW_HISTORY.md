# Block28 author-side conformance review

Review date: `2026-08-30`

Intended stacked base: Record PR `#7812`, head
`83b607eb6a3040b831809389711e886f7b934488`.

## 1. Self-containment

The Block28 branch contains its runner, canonical cache, bounded-theorem note,
source pin, assumptions/imports, preregistration amendment, execution history,
claim certificate, trace gates, panel return, and handoff.  It deliberately
imports the Block23, Block24, and Block26 results already present on PR `#7812`;
the eventual pull request must therefore remain stacked on that exact Record
branch unless the parent stack lands first.

## 2. Cache and execution discipline

The final runner declares `AUDIT_TIMEOUT_SEC = 900`.  It was executed through
`cached_runner_output.py --refresh` without a command-line timeout override.
The wrapper recorded runner SHA-256
`91141d7b917b52eef1335cc6d405acd5927d75ab32ce2f4e0620d4c9007b9a2a`,
`19`-input fingerprint
`334e234780033a19357d2443a153b300c494e9975ad7fc22625087fe7cc6e8df`,
exit zero, empty stderr, and `588.66` seconds.  The canonical cache SHA-256 is
`78562003af71a691a285824386945888fe3e9a74b84a0f76574b469f65b81726`;
`--check-only` reports it `fresh`.

## 3. Claim-scope honesty

The only positive claim is existence of two supplied-`q`, externally invoked,
conditional compound CPTP instruments on one supplied finite pair sector.
The note and cache explicitly exclude singleton extension, repeated use,
autonomous invocation, resource renewal, a microscopic compiler, cadence,
gravity/source attachment, process-law selection, axiom amendment, audit
retention, obligation retirement, and TOE-score movement.

## 4. Negative-claim N-gate

The postexecution No-Go Discipline packet runs N1--N8.  Its broad-negative
gate is `FAIL`: the alternative process routes remain live, so the original
underselection question is demoted to partial narrowing and is not claimed.
The theorem note carries only a bounded positive existence result with named
open walls.

## 5. Proof obligations

The note states the exact target and maps every obligation either to exact
finite algebra in this block or to a named conditional parent import.  It
names the open common-extension lemma and the next visible-common-cause
depth-two discriminator; no unproved process-level conclusion is folded into
the theorem.

## 6. Runner validity

The runner checks the literal local factors, all source-pair controls, guarded
Gram rows, projector plus complement STOP identity, both complete channels,
all proper-cubic frames, translated carriers, label injectivity, decoded
Record odds, and arbitrary-reference extension.  It fails closed and rejects
`24/24` designated altered models.  Three independent exact-byte static
attacks rederived the key algebra without importing or executing the target
and returned `SAFE` before the final run.

## 7. Packet completeness

The packet contains the authority gate, goal, state, assumptions/imports,
route portfolio, opportunity queue, approach registry, artifact and mutation
plans, preregistration plus amendment, source pin, preflight witnesses,
independent static attack, execution history, postexecution state, claim
certificate, N1--N8 sidecar, trace records, panel return, TOE lane update,
review history, and handoff.

## 8. Links, graph, and generated artifacts

The new auditable note adds exactly one citation-graph node and four outgoing
dependency edges: `5,662 -> 5,663` nodes and `16,282 -> 16,286` edges.  The
co-landed manifest records dependency hash `75eb91c48c8f`.  Enforced repository
link validation reports zero violations.  Repository-wide pipeline-generated
ledger and classifier residue was restored or removed; no author-side audit
verdict or generated ledger row is included.

## 9. Note structure

The theorem note has explicit frontmatter for claim type, actual and
conditional status, trace class, blocker target, dependencies and roles,
runner/cache, N-gate, audit boundary, and TOE non-movement.  Its body includes
the target, equations, proof-obligation table, executed evidence, exact
boundary, next discriminator, TOE table, and author review record.

## 10. Propose/ratify boundary

This branch proposes author-side conditional support only.  It does not edit
audit verdicts, effective status, minimal axioms, obligation state, or TOE
scores.  Independent audit remains unset and `bare_retained_allowed` remains
false.

## 11. Sourced facts and counts

The runner recomputes all cited finite counts: `1,568` literal turn branches,
`196` orthogonal source-pair controls, `16` exit-pair cells, `56` local Record
labels per tip, `3,136` pair configurations, `24` proper-cubic frames, and
matching-exit probabilities `1/4` and `5/8`.  The postexecution panel derives
the two joint matrices' nonnegative ranks `1` and `4`; that fact is used only
to dispatch the next experiment, not to promote the current claim.

## 12. Pre-review gates

- vocabulary lint: zero violations;
- runner syntax compilation: pass;
- canonical cache freshness: pass;
- strict audit lint: exit zero, no errors; inherited warnings/notices only;
- changed-audit-evidence check against the stacked base: zero failures;
- changed-audit-evidence check against `origin/main`: two checked, zero
  failures;
- enforced repository invariants and links: pass with zero link or class-F
  violations and acknowledged graph delta; and
- full pipeline: graph, seeding, runner classification, and effective status
  completed, then stage 7 reproduced the inherited dependency-policy epoch
  mismatch.  This branch changes neither the governed policy sources nor the
  epoch manifest, and no Block28 science gate failed.

At the final packaging check, `origin/main` remained
`0ef479978b7129e958281662db478fb0cd4f5ef3`; Record PR `#7812` and
gravity/action PR `#7803` were both clean at their previously inspected heads.
No `review-loop` was invoked.
