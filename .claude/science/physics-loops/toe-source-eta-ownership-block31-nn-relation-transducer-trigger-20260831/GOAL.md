# Block31 goal

Replace Block30's host-level joint `(g,h)` decoder with a literal finite
nearest-neighbor message-and-comparison layer on the exact Block28 output
sector.

For a returned pair with left anchor `L`, right anchor `R=L+9f`, and lateral
directions `D_f`, the eight candidate outputs are `L+9d` and `R+9d`.  Exactly
one candidate on each arm is Locked and the other three are exact Blank.  A
Locked word has all six STATUS bits equal to one; a Blank pointer has all 26
bits zero.  The runner must therefore derive, without calling a Record decoder,
two physical four-way one-hot messages from covariantly chosen STATUS samples,
transport them through fresh nearest-neighbor rails, and reversibly compute:

- the unique ordered-pair selector `(g,h)`;
- the equal, opposite, or perpendicular orbit class; and
- exactly one of sixteen ordered-pair token cells on the promised sector.

The runner must prove an exact correspondence from each token to the frozen
Block30 five-step route and preserve the common survival of both supplied
Block28 `lambda` laws.  It must recompute rail freshness, local gate support,
truth tables, proper-cubic covariance, logical side exchange, QND preservation,
and scratch cleanup.  It may also test an abstract full-space Ready/STOP
projector specification, but it must not call that a compiled local validator,
latch, bypass, or physical dispatch.

This is a scheduled finite circuit theorem.  The 28 computational-Blank M2s,
76 borrowed M2s, internal basis frame, fixed opposite-route chirality, gate
layers, and invocation are supplied.  A green result may replace the nonlocal host
comparison by an exact nearest-neighbor ordered-pair transducer.  It may not
claim a physical full-space STOP, no-refire latch, controlled successor
dispatch, autonomous time-homogeneous Admissibility law, physical cadence, a
framework Record for the internal token, resource renewal, gravity, an axiom
amendment, obligation retirement, or TOE-score movement.
