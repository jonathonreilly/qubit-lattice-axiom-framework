The final source differs from the independently reviewed logic hash only by
substituting the final frozen static-attack digest after that artifact recorded
the independently checked stdout compaction.  This pin is itself one of the 26
declared inputs, so it omits a purported full-input fingerprint.  The
content-bound execution computes and records that fingerprint.
