The final source differs from the independently reviewed logic source only by
replacing the review-time `PENDING` static-attack digest with the exact attack
file SHA-256.

## Adversarial development sequence

1. The first implementation passed its component algebra but had an expensive
   symbolic eigenvalue check.  It was stopped after 152 seconds, the bottleneck
   was replaced by an exact Gram factorization, and runtime fell below seven
   seconds.
2. The first independent attack rejected the source for an unexecuted
   universal equality bridge, substring-only terminal protection, incomplete
   frozen mutation mapping, and unsafe identity-failure continuation.
3. The source added the finite positive-weight SOS schema, product-response
   rank-one minors, exact forty-name mutation manifest, nineteen model and
   nineteen terminal promotions, exact terminal equality, and fail-fast
   identity handling.
4. The second independent attack found point-only false-green seams in the
   coherent phase and depth-three epsilon, plus missing history-law provenance
   and bank insertion-time semantics.  Exact family-drift mutants, formula
   binding, an availability ledger, lambda-response provenance, explicit Choi
   matrices, and the closed endpoint check were added.
5. The pin review caught a 62-character transcription of the minimal-axiom
   digest.  The digest was corrected and all direct/frozen pins were enumerated
   independently before the reviewer returned `PASS TO PIN`.

No negative claim was released from an incomplete run.

## Canonical execution

Command:

```bash
python3 scripts/precompute_audit_runners.py \
  --runners scripts/admissibility_d4_classical_screening_cause_renewal_locus_gate_2026_08_31.py \
  --force --concurrency 1 --push-mode none
```

Result:

- exit code: `0`
- elapsed time: `6.73 s`
- stdout bytes: `4,435`
- cache bytes including header/stderr framing: `4,825`
- result: `PASS=15 FAIL=0`
- mutations: `78/78` rejected
- cache status after execution: `fresh`
- cache SHA-256:
  `31d266fb29b05903a0decdb166de1a4963f4e596d9261c3c7c633143cf23c522`

## Scientific disposition

Retained:

- the exact static rank/resource classification;
- the existential frozen classical-screening locus `{lambda=0}`;
- full-interval supplied-iid and coherent positive controls;
- a positive full-interval three-use counterhistory with every pair marginal
  product.

Not retained or claimed:

- physical reset/renewal;
- Nature's value of `lambda`;
- a local M2 cause carrier or third Block32 transaction;
- normalized source/gravity attachment;
- axiom change, audit verdict, obligation retirement, or TOE-score movement.
