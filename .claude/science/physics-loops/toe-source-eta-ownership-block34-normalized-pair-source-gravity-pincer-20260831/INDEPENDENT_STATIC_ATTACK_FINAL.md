# Block34 independent static attack — final

Verdict: `PASS TO PIN`

Reviewed logic SHA-256:
`7e0b0531a7e7030bba03d6f97199ee73632f09fbf87177640651ad90e7002a58`

The reviewed source contains exactly one review-time assignment
`STATIC_ATTACK_SHA256 = "PENDING"`.  The final source may differ from this
reviewed logic only by replacing that value with the SHA-256 of this file.  The
runner normalizes the assignment back to `PENDING`, hashes the normalized
source, and requires equality with the independently recorded reviewed-logic
hash in `RUNNER_SOURCE_PIN.md`.

## Independent attacks and corrections

Three read-only independent roles attacked the mathematics, authority surface,
prior-art interpretation, output rhetoric, and pin recursion.

### Fixed-reference/Fisher interpretation

The first draft incorrectly promoted
`Var_q_lambda(O)=1` to a Fisher/action/source-unit condition.  Independent
recalculation established

```text
E_lambda O = sqrt(3) lambda
Var_lambda(O) = (1-lambda)(1+3lambda)
s_lambda = sqrt(3)(O-sqrt(3)lambda)/Var_lambda(O)
I(lambda) = 3/Var_lambda(O)
```

The source now calls `{0,2/3}` only the equal-variance recurrence of one fixed
score direction normalized at `q0`.  It identifies the roots with diagonal
probabilities `1/4` and `3/4`, executes arbitrary-reference drift, and states
that the recurrence is not a physical Fisher, action, source, or selector law.

### Orbit grammar

The first draft called the contrast unique without naming its grammar.  The
source now derives `(sqrt(3),-1/sqrt(3))` symbolically only within the
equality/off-diagonal partition.  It separately enumerates the actual fixed-
front `D4` orbits (4 same, 4 opposite, 8 perpendicular) and verifies the
distinct centered unit witness `(sqrt(2),-sqrt(2),0)`.

### Actual tensor, count-once ownership, and Ward boundary

Independent algebra reproduced

```text
C_lambda = lambda(I-ff^T)/2
C_bad = (5lambda-1)(I-ff^T)/8
p^T C_lambda = lambda[p-(p.f)f]^T/2.
```

The source parses parent carrier counts `(2,158,14,146)` rather than relying on
an unbound local debit assertion.  It labels the algebraic opposite tensor as
bookkeeping rather than physical recoil.  The `omega != 0` completion is bound
to `#6269@eb0ea608`, typed `open_pr_conditional`, and rejects promotions to a
retained, zero-mode, cadence, or local-lattice four-stress law.

### Canonical authority

The first draft read two branch-stale audit files and omitted two approved
primitive documents.  The corrected runner binds eleven exact Git blobs at
`aa7338d1fbc34a4b92205182b26793194e4727b6`, checking both Git blob ids and
body SHA-256 values.  It follows every current path in the four-node foundation
registry: minimal axioms, scale reference, kinetic isotropy, and realized
state.  It also reads the three closest named normalization notes and their
current ledger rows.  Independent verification passed `11/11` objects.

The conclusion is deliberately snapshot-narrow: the inspected canonical
foundation does not supply this physical source identity, privileged measure,
unit, coupling, or nonzero-source principle; the three closest mechanisms are
conditional and unaudited.  No repo-wide impossibility claim is made.

### Scope and governance

The first draft instantiated twenty false defaults.  The corrected source
derives a typed scope from the executed geometry/Ward results, canonical
authority result, parent renewal boundary, symbolic free conversion, and a
separate completed `POSTEXECUTION_STATE.yaml`.  Axiom change and approved-
primitive change are distinct fields.  The exact terminal is independently
frozen in `POSTEXECUTION_EXPECTED_TERMINAL.txt`, and the AST output-site check
allows `print` only in `main` and the N5 resolution emitter.

The landed postexecution N1--N8 sidecar uses nine formal `ATTEMPTED` routes,
separates live routes outside the negative, audits all 21 wall pairs, gives
exact commit/path/line residual witnesses, steelmans the positive `2/3` route,
and limits the negative to the executed homogeneous and fixed-reference
routes.

### Source-pin recursion and fail-closed behavior

The pin parser requires exactly these six unique keys and rejects unknown or
duplicate keys:

```text
source_sha256
reviewed_logic_sha256
independent_attack_sha256
declared_input_count
canonical_cache
state
```

It verifies the final source hash, normalized reviewed-logic hash, attack
digest, declared input count, cache path, and final state.  Any content-identity
failure exits before science evaluation and prints all five N5 resolutions as
not executed.

The first real pin file exposed a final parser defect that synthetic pin
mutation tests had missed: the key grammar `[a-z_]+` rejected the digits in
the required `sha256` keys.  The direct runner failed closed before science.
The grammar was corrected to `[a-z0-9_]+`; the actual file then parsed all six
ordered keys, and missing, reordered, duplicate, unknown, and all nine named
pin mutations were independently rejected.  The final authority/static
reviewer attested the new normalized logic hash above.  The only executable-
logic delta from the preceding fully reviewed source is that character-class
correction; the contemporaneous N8 digest update only records that PRs
`#7764/#7784` closed unmerged while `#6269/#6285` remained open.

## Final independent results

- canonical authority objects: `11/11`;
- declared runner inputs: `24` (`4` direct + `18` frozen + attack + pin);
- science mutations rejected: `46/46`;
- source/input/pin identity mutations rejected in simulated final state:
  `32/32`;
- model-scope promotions rejected: `20/20`;
- terminal promotions rejected: `20/20`;
- simulated consistent final run: return `0`, `21` lines, `3,976` stdout
  characters, five substantive N5 lines, one terminal, final
  `TOTAL: PASS=14 FAIL=0`;
- current unpinned direct run: fail closed with `TOTAL: PASS=0 FAIL=1`.

The math/semantics reviewer and prior-art reviewer returned `PASS TO PIN` on
the unchanged science logic.  The authority/static reviewer returned final
`PASS TO PIN` on the exact reviewed hash above, including the real pin parser
and current PR-state wording.  No audit verdict, retained-grade promotion,
obligation retirement, axiom change, primitive change, or TOE percentage
movement follows from this static review.
