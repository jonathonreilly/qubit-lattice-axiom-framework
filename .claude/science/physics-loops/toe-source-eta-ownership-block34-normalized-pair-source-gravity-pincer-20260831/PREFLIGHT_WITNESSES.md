# Block34 preflight witnesses

These formulas are preregistration targets, not execution results.

For fixed unit front `f` and actual lateral exits `+u,-u,+v,-v`, define
`P_f=I-f f^T`.  Direct summation of the sixteen Block32 weights should give

```text
E[g]=E[h]=0,
E[g g^T]=E[h h^T]=P_f/2,
C_lambda=E[g h^T]=lambda P_f/2,
tr(C_lambda)=lambda,
f^T C_lambda=0,
||C_lambda||_F^2=lambda^2/2.
```

For generic spatial momentum `k`, the runner must retain the residual

```text
k^T C_lambda = lambda (k-(k.f)f)^T/2.
```

Thus front transversality becomes a spatial Ward statement only after a
separate `k parallel f` source/momentum identification.  A complete
four-dimensional source also needs `T00`, `T0i`, cadence, and a zero-mode
prescription.

Any lambda-independent homogeneous linear constraint `L(C)=0` has the exact
ray dichotomy

```text
L(C_lambda)=lambda L(P_f/2).
```

It therefore retains every lambda when the unit shape is allowed, or retains
only `lambda=0` when it is not.  It cannot select a unique positive value.
A linear gravity response with free coupling reads only the product
`g_source lambda`.

For the equality/off-diagonal orbit partition, the unique diagonal-positive
function with uniform counting mean zero and variance one is

```text
O(g,h)=(4 delta_(g,h)-1)/sqrt(3).
```

Under `q_lambda`, the planned exact checks are

```text
E[O]=sqrt(3) lambda,
E[O^2]=1+2 lambda,
Var(O)=(1-lambda)(1+3 lambda),
Var(O)=1  iff  lambda in {0,2/3}.
```

Requiring a nonzero centered source would leave the conditional candidate
`lambda=2/3`.  The control must normalize the same one-dimensional contrast
at an arbitrary reference `lambda_0`.  Unit-norm matching then becomes

```text
Var_lambda(O)/Var_lambda0(O)=1,
(lambda-lambda_0)(2-3(lambda+lambda_0))=0.
```

This exposes whether the apparent `2/3` is fixed by physical authority or by
privileging the uniform `lambda_0=0` reference.
