# Block34 preregistration amendment: Ward completion and count-once pair source

This amendment was frozen after the independent interface and tensor lenses
returned, before the first complete runner execution.

## Conditional arbitrary-stress Ward completion

PR `#6269` head `eb0ea60817a7489d2ed435780ffb5354b0e06045`
contains a conditional continuum completion for any symmetric spatial stress
`S` at nonzero frequency:

```text
T^(it)=(S q)_i/omega,
T^(tt)=q^T S q/omega^2.
```

For the actual Block32 pair tensor

```text
C_lambda=lambda(I-f f^T)/2,
```

the completed components are

```text
T_lambda^(it)=lambda(q_i-f_i(f.q))/(2 omega),
T_lambda^(tt)=lambda(||q||^2-(f.q)^2)/(2 omega^2).
```

This is the strongest positive Ward control: generic spatial momentum does not
exclude the pair source once the missing time components are supplied.  The
entire completed source remains proportional to `lambda`, so every homogeneous
Ward identity still retains the full positive ray.  The construction is
conditional on an open PR and leaves `omega=0`, cadence, source birth,
Record-to-stress typing, normalization, coupling, debit, and the selected
gravity law open.

The runner must therefore distinguish:

1. the bare spatial tensor, which is front-transverse but not generic-momentum
   transverse;
2. the conditional nonzero-frequency four-stress completion, which is Ward
   compatible for every `lambda`;
3. a physically owned local lattice source law, which is not constructed by
   either item.

## Count-once unordered pair source

For unordered pairs define

```text
p_{g,g}=q(g,g),
p_{g,h}=2q(g,h) for g<h,
B_{g,g}=g g^T,
B_{g,h}=(g h^T+h g^T)/2 for g<h.
```

Then the ten unordered probabilities sum to one and

```text
sum_{g<=h} p_{g,h} B_{g,h}=C_lambda.
```

If the off-diagonal unordered weights are then counted a second time, the
wrong tensor is

```text
C_bad=(5 lambda-1)(I-f f^T)/8,
```

which is already nonzero at `lambda=0`.  This is the designated source
double-count mutation.  Correct count-once algebra does not yet supply a
physical source carrier or branchwise field-work recoil.

## Zero-mode fork

An unrecoiled periodic sum of `N` identical sources has trace proportional to
`N lambda`; a zero-total-source rule would then leave only `lambda=0`.
Equal opposite recoil cancels the zero mode for every `lambda`.  Open/fixed
boundaries, a background, or a reservoir change the premise.  No zero-mode
architecture is selected here, so no zero-mode result may be promoted to a
universal parameter selector.
