## Result up front

Declare the following weak-field dynamics class on the role-compiled physical
lattice:

1. one real electric component lives at each edge-role site and one real
   magnetic component at each face-role site;
2. evolution is real, linear, first order, and continuous in time;
3. a site derivative may use its own component and the dynamical components
   among its six physical nearest neighbors, but no farther site;
4. the law is translation- and proper-cubic-covariant;
5. the edge-to-face map is invariant under `A -> A+d_0 lambda` and preserves
   the magnetic Gauss row;
6. a positive, diagonal, proper-cubic field energy is conserved; and
7. no vertex, cube, extra coin, or hidden time payload participates.

Within this exact class, every nonzero generator is equivalent by positive
field rescaling to

```text
dot E = -c C^T B,
dot B =  c C E,
```

where `C` is the oriented physical edge-to-face curl and `c>0` is one overall
speed. There is no second stencil, mass term, damping term, orientation
coefficient, or same-role nearest-neighbor term inside the class.

The classification has four steps:

- gauge invariance on one face star leaves the one-dimensional stencil
  `(1,1,-1,-1)`;
- proper cubic covariance makes its coefficient equal on all face
  orientations;
- the period-two role geometry has no edge-edge or face-face nearest-neighbor
  pairs, so only edge-face blocks and real onsite scalars remain; and
- positive diagonal energy conservation kills the onsite scalars and fixes
  the reverse block to be the weighted negative adjoint.

The remaining positive coefficients are only field normalization and speed.
If equal lattice kinetic normalization is applied to this already selected
class, `c=1` in lattice units. The classified generator consequently carries
exactly the two transverse Maxwell branches established in the direct parent.

This materially sharpens the time-selection issue. The conservative Maxwell
law is not merely one arbitrary local example: it is the only member of a
small, explicit, physically motivated class. The four axioms do not currently
select that class. In particular, they do not state real linear first-order
evolution, energy conservation, minimal `(E,B)` payload, or continuous time.
Those are now the exact assumptions requiring derivation, model selection, or
a narrowly considered primitive/axiom decision.

## 1. Exact declared class

Call the class `M_min`. Its field content and rule shape are fixed as follows.

### M1 — field content

Each edge role carries one real `E` component and each face role one real `B`
component. Vertex and cube roles carry no dynamical component. The finite
Record auxiliary and compact link payloads of the static parent may remain as
separate possibility data, but they do not enter this linear classification.

### M2 — locality and order

The time derivative at a physical site is a real linear function of its own
field and fields at the six nearest neighbors. It contains no memory, second
time derivative, external clock variable, or finite-step inverse.

### M3 — lattice symmetry

The same law is used at every site. Proper cubic rotations carry edge
orientation into edge orientation and face normal into face normal. No
orientation has an independent coefficient.

### M4 — gauge and chain constraints

The magnetic response to an edge potential is unchanged by an exact gradient,
and the edge-to-face response has zero cube divergence:

```text
L d_0=0,                  d_2 L=0.
```

### M5 — conservative metric

There is a positive diagonal energy

```text
H=(w_E/2)||E||^2+(w_B/2)||B||^2,
w_E,w_B>0,
```

with the same weight on all cubic images of a role. The generator preserves
`H` for every field.

### M6 — minimal payload

No additional vertex, cube, coin, duplicated configuration, or longer-range
field is allowed. This is a classification assumption, not an axiom claim.
Dropping it reopens several routes listed below.

## 2. Gauge invariance fixes one face stencil

Take one oriented square with vertices `0,1,2,3` and boundary links

```text
a:0->1,  b:1->2,  c:3->2,  d:0->3.
```

A general face response inside `M_min` is

```text
L_f(A)=x_a a+x_b b+x_c c+x_d d.
```

Under vertex gauge values `(lambda_0,...,lambda_3)`, the four links change by

```text
a -> a-lambda_0+lambda_1,
b -> b-lambda_1+lambda_2,
c -> c-lambda_3+lambda_2,
d -> d-lambda_0+lambda_3.
```

Requiring the coefficient of every `lambda_v` to vanish gives

```text
-x_a-x_d=0,
 x_a-x_b=0,
 x_b+x_c=0,
-x_c+x_d=0.
```

The integer constraint matrix has rank three and one-dimensional nullspace

```text
(x_a,x_b,x_c,x_d)=q(1,1,-1,-1).
```

This is the oriented curl. The result needs neither a continuum limit nor a
Fourier argument. The runner performs exact rational row reduction and also
enumerates all `5^4=625` coefficient vectors with entries from `-2` to `2`:
each gauge-invariant vector is a curl multiple, and every other one has an
explicit gauge residual.

## 3. Proper cubic covariance leaves one spatial coefficient

Applying the face calculation separately to the `xy`, `xz`, and `yz`
orientations initially leaves three scalars `(q_xy,q_xz,q_yz)`. The 24 proper
cubic rotations act transitively on the six oriented face normals. Covariance
therefore requires

```text
q_xy=q_xz=q_yz=q.
```

The combined exact constraint matrix has 12 stencil variables, gauge rank
nine, and two independent orientation equalities. Its nullspace is one
dimensional with basis

```text
(curl_xy,curl_xz,curl_yz).
```

An orientation-dependent coefficient is not a second covariant solution. It
is the anisotropy control and splits the transverse branches.

## 4. The role geometry removes same-role neighbor blocks

Every edge-role site has two vertex and four face neighbors. Every face-role
site has four edge and two cube neighbors. There are no nearest-neighbor
edge-edge or face-face pairs.

Under M1 and M6, a derivative may therefore contain only:

- an onsite real scalar multiplying the same field; and
- the four opposite-role components in its incidence star.

No general vector-valued onsite mixing is hidden here: the three cubic
components occupy three different physical sites. A complex onsite phase or
an internal multiplet would leave the declared real one-component class.

The runner checks every role shell on the side-six physical lattice. It then
assembles the unique local curl rows into the full `81 x 81` incidence matrix
and rechecks `C d_0=0` and `d_2 C=0` over integers.

## 5. Conservation fixes the reverse block

Write the most general remaining real generator as

```text
G = [[u I,  r C^T],
     [q C,  v I ]].
```

Energy conservation for every `(E,B)` is equivalent to

```text
G^T diag(w_E I,w_B I)+diag(w_E I,w_B I)G=0.
```

The diagonal blocks give

```text
2 w_E u=0,                2 w_B v=0,
```

so positivity forces `u=v=0`. The cross block gives

```text
w_E r+w_B q=0,
```

or

```text
r=-(w_B/w_E)q.
```

Thus the edge response is the weighted negative adjoint of the face response.
Let

```text
alpha=q,                  beta=-r,
```

with the orientation convention chosen so `alpha,beta>0`. Rescale fields by

```text
E'=sqrt(w_E)E,            B'=sqrt(w_B)B.
```

The generator becomes

```text
G' = c [[0,-C^T],[C,0]],
c=sqrt(alpha beta).
```

All allowed positive coefficient choices are therefore the same generator
after field normalization, with one remaining time scale `c`.

The runner checks four unequal positive coefficient pairs, conservation,
both Gauss rows, their spectra, and the explicit similarity transform. A
same-sign adjoint mutation and a damping mutation both fail the metric-skew
condition.

## 6. Spectrum inherited by the unique class

For staggered Fourier symbol

```text
s_i=2 sin(k_i/2),
```

the unique curl has singular values `(0,|s|,|s|)`. Therefore the normalized
generator has

```text
spec(iG')=(-c|s|,-c|s|,0,0,+c|s|,+c|s|).
```

After the electric and magnetic Gauss rows remove the two longitudinal zero
directions, there are exactly two positive-frequency transverse modes. The
runner rechecks every momentum on `L=3,4,5,7`. This is not a new photon count
beyond the direct parent; it establishes that every member of `M_min` has the
same count and dispersion.

The direct parent's Record-overlap curvature can be assigned

```text
beta=kappa,               alpha=1/kappa,
```

giving `c=1`. More abstractly, once `M_min` is selected, the approved
kinetic-isotropy primitive can normalize the remaining space/time kinetic
ratio to one in lattice units. It does not select M1-M6 and supplies no
dynamics on its own.

## 7. Why an exact local tick remains open

The theorem classifies a continuous-time local generator. A finite tick has a
separate locality/unitarity tension:

- the explicit Euler map `I+dt G` retains radius one but satisfies

  ```text
  (I+dt G)^T(I+dt G)=I+dt^2 G^T G,
  ```

  so it is not exactly norm preserving;
- the Cayley map

  ```text
  (I+dt G/2)(I-dt G/2)^(-1)
  ```

  is exactly norm preserving, but the inverse spreads a one-tick row beyond
  the physical star.

On the full 162-variable runner block, every Cayley row has more than ten
nonzero entries at the declared tolerance. This does not prove that no exact
finite-depth local tick exists. Split-step edge-face rotations, Trotter
circuits, quantum cellular automata, and enlarged coins remain live.

This is now the sharpest dynamics compiler residual: the infinitesimal law is
unique inside M1-M6, while a strictly radius-one exact unitary tick has not
been selected or constructed.

## 8. What is and is not selected

The direct parent displayed three inequivalent time uses of the static
spatial kernel: conservative Maxwell evolution, a diffusive sampler, and a
two-reflection spectral lift. This theorem explains how a minimal physical
criterion separates them:

- energy conservation excludes the dissipative sampler;
- M6 excludes the doubled walk/coin space of the spectral lift; and
- real one-component physical-neighbor locality plus gauge invariance leaves
  the curl generator.

That is a conditional selection theorem, not an axiom derivation. The four
framework axioms state a local conditional probability distribution and
permanent Records. They do not require conservative continuous-time flow,
minimal dynamical payload, or linear weak-field evolution.

There are now two honest program choices:

1. treat M1-M6 as defining the candidate physical law and continue testing
   compact interactions, matter coupling, and phenomenology; or
2. seek a derivation of M1-M6 from a smaller principle, and if no existing
   premise can provide it, decide whether a conservative local-dynamics
   principle belongs in the approved primitive/axiom boundary.

No axiom edit is made here. The theorem supplies the exact language needed
for that decision without expanding Admissibility by implication.

## 9. Executable evidence

The runner reports `TOTAL: PASS=24 FAIL=0`. It checks:

- exact rational rank and nullspace of the one-face gauge constraints;
- every one of 625 small integer stencils and a sign mutation;
- the three-orientation gauge space and one-dimensional cubic subspace;
- the orbit of all six oriented normals under 24 proper rotations;
- every edge/face shell on the physical block and absence of same-role
  nearest neighbors;
- assembly of the global `81 x 81` curl and both chain identities;
- onsite exclusion, weighted-adjoint conservation, four coefficient pairs,
  both Gauss rows, field rescaling, and the complete mode spectrum;
- anisotropy, same-sign, damping, and missing-orientation controls; and
- local Euler versus norm-preserving nonlocal Cayley ticks.

## No-Go Discipline Gate

This note makes a uniqueness statement inside M1-M6 and two bounded tick
statements. The gate prevents those results from being generalized into a
claim that Maxwell dynamics is axiom-forced or that an exact local tick is
impossible.

### N1 — Alternative route enumeration

| Route | Mechanism and outcome |
|---|---|
| minimal real edge-face class | M1-M6 plus gauge and conservation. **Positive:** unique curl generator up to speed. |
| dissipative sampler | Keep the static measure, drop conservation. Positive but diffusive; outside M5. |
| two-reflection lift | Enlarge the state with a walk copy/coin. Positive infrared phase; outside M6. |
| complex onsite phase | Allow complex one-component fields. A conservative onsite phase becomes possible; outside M1. |
| vertex/cube payload | Add scalar or constraint carriers at the remaining roles. Live; outside M1 and M6. |
| longer-range stencil | Read beyond the physical star. Gauge-invariant improved curls may exist; outside M2. |
| split-step local tick | Compose local edge-face rotations in substeps. Live; not tested by the Euler/Cayley pair. |
| second-order wave law | Evolve `A` with `ddot A=-C^T C A`. Positive continuum form; outside first-order M2 and less directly physical-local after eliminating faces. |

The uniqueness conclusion is explicitly conditional on retaining every M1-M6
boundary.

### N2 — Wall-independence audit

```text
W1 = derivation or adoption of M1-M6,
W2 = exact finite local tick,
W3 = enlarged payload/internal implementation,
W4 = Record formation and measurement bridge,
W5 = compact nonlinear/interacting stability,
W6 = electromagnetic and matter-coupling dictionary.
```

| Pair | `Wi -> Wj`? | `Wj -> Wi`? | Independent? |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| W1, W2 | no | no | yes |
| W1, W3 | no | no | yes |
| W1, W4 | no | no | yes |
| W1, W5 | no | no | yes |
| W1, W6 | no | no | yes |
| W2, W3 | no | no | yes |
| W2, W4 | no | no | yes |
| W2, W5 | no | no | yes |
| W2, W6 | no | no | yes |
| W3, W4 | no | no | yes |
| W3, W5 | no | no | yes |
| W3, W6 | no | no | yes |
| W4, W5 | no | no | yes |
| W4, W6 | no | no | yes |
| W5, W6 | no | no | yes |

A unique infinitesimal stencil does not build a tick; a tick does not explain
Record formation; nonlinear stability does not identify electromagnetism.

### N3 — Hidden-wall scan

“Declare,” “within,” and “conditional” mark M1-M6. “Unique” never appears
without that class. The fields are real and one-component per role. The energy
metric is positive, diagonal, and cubic. Continuous time is supplied. The
Cayley density check is a finite exhibit, not a theorem about every unitary
integrator. Kinetic isotropy is used only after the dynamics class is chosen.

### N4 — Residual matching

| Surface | Residual | Match here |
|---|---|---|
| direct dynamics parent | static law leaves a three-way time fork | **partial closure:** M1-M6 select the conservative edge-face branch |
| role compiler | physical edge/face incidence but no dynamics | **exact:** its neighbor graph is the classified stencil domain |
| minimal axioms | no dynamics, Hamiltonian, or tick | **no import:** M1-M6 remain downstream assumptions |
| kinetic-isotropy primitive | equal kinetic form but no selector | **exact boundary:** fixes the last speed only after class selection |
| open PR #7903 | compact fermion/U1 Hamiltonian join | **future composition:** no finite interacting spectrum imported |
| open PR #7911 | spin-half ring is gapped | **no conflict:** different payload and three-dimensional weak-field class |

The classification is self-contained after both open-PR pointers are removed.

### N5 — Rhetoric and resolution audit

“No second stencil” means no second stencil inside M1-M6. “Onsite term is
killed” means a real scalar onsite term under positive diagonal conservation.
“Cayley spreads” is tested on the named finite block. No universal no-go for
complex fields, extra payloads, longer range, nonlinear laws, finite-depth
circuits, or discrete time is asserted.

The cached output carries:

```text
per_element: all 625 small face stencils and every exact gauge constraint row are classified
per_site: the full L3 role geometry excludes same-role neighbors and leaves four edge-face couplings
per_mode: every momentum on L=3,4,5,7 is checked for the unique two-branch spectrum
per_block: gauge, cubic, energy-adjoint, field-rescaling, Euler, and Cayley blocks are contrasted
lattice_wide: the global 81-by-81 curl and 162-variable generator are assembled from the unique stencil
```

### N6 — Partial-closure paths and primitive check

The approved primitive registry was reread. Kinetic isotropy supplies only the
equal kinetic-form ratio; scale reference supplies units; realized-state
evaluation supplies no dynamics. None supplies M1-M6 or an exact tick.

The shortest live positive paths are:

- construct a finite-depth split-step unitary on the same edge-face stars and
  test whether its only infrared branches are the classified photons;
- derive conservation from a probability or reversibility principle without
  reintroducing the dissipative sampler;
- show the minimal payload follows from the one-site algebra or from an
  orthogonal spatial composite; or
- adopt M1-M6 as the candidate law and attack compact interacting stability.

### N7 — Steelman

A hostile reviewer can argue that M1-M6 were chosen precisely to describe
Maxwell, so uniqueness is circular. Gauge invariance does real work: before
it, one face has four independent coefficients; it reduces them to the curl.
Cubic symmetry reduces three orientation coefficients to one, and energy
conservation fixes the reverse map and removes damping. Nonetheless, choosing
real linear first-order conservative minimal fields is physical input. The
theorem narrows that input; it does not erase it.

The reviewer can also argue that a continuous generator is not the
framework's emergent tick. The Euler/Cayley control confirms the distinction,
and the tick remains an explicit top-priority residual.

### N8 — Cross-cycle echo

The direct parent exhibited multiple time laws with one static kernel. This
classification resolves that echo only after adding M1-M6. The kinetic-
isotropy source independently warns that equality of kinetic coefficients is
not a dynamics selector. Both boundaries survive unchanged.

**Gate result:** PASS for the scoped uniqueness and tick statements. Eight
routes were separated, the exact nullspaces and global generator were
executed, and every route outside M1-M6 remains open by name.

## Falsifiers

The conditional theorem fails if any of the following occurs inside M1-M6:

- a gauge-invariant one-face stencil is not proportional to
  `(1,1,-1,-1)`;
- proper cubic covariance permits unequal orientation coefficients;
- the role geometry contains a same-role physical nearest-neighbor pair;
- a nonzero real onsite scalar preserves a positive diagonal energy;
- conservation permits a reverse block not equal to the weighted negative
  adjoint;
- two allowed generators with the same speed are not related by positive
  field rescaling;
- an allowed nonzero momentum lacks exactly two transverse branches; or
- the exact Euler or Cayley controls have the opposite locality/norm behavior
  on the named block.
