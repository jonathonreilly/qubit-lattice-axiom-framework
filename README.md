# ai/execution — AI execution surface (never merges)

Standing NON-science branch: the durable, versioned home for AI
planning/targeting surfaces — TOE closure scorecard, and (as they accrue)
campaign briefs, dispatch specs, strategy notes. Established at owner request
2026-08-07.

## Contract

- **This branch NEVER merges into `main`.** It is an orphan root (no shared
  history), so `git merge` refuses it as unrelated histories — a structural
  guard, not just a convention. `main` remains the sole authority for science
  content and audit status; everything here is derived, non-authoritative
  planning material.
- **Direct pushes are allowed here; `main` stays PR-only.** Commit messages
  carry `[skip ci]` so branch pushes don't trigger workflow runs.
- **The audit pipeline reads `main`'s tree only** — files here are invisible
  to the citation graph BY DESIGN. Never copy or check these files out into a
  `main` working tree: untracked docs in a working tree pollute the audit
  pipeline.
- **Language rules:** framework-terms-only applies to `main` PRs and notes,
  not here. Internal planning vocabulary (root labels, fanout rankings) is
  fine on this branch and must not migrate into science surfaces.
- **Pointer legend:** backticked `project_*` / `feedback_*` names are Claude
  session-memory pointers (local to the operating machine), not repo paths.
  References to `docs/...` files resolve on `origin/main`, not on this branch.

## Read (from any checkout, without touching your working tree)

```bash
git fetch origin ai/execution --quiet
git show origin/ai/execution:TOE_SCORECARD.md
```

## Edit flow

```bash
git worktree add /tmp/ai-exec-wt ai/execution
# edit files in /tmp/ai-exec-wt
git -C /tmp/ai-exec-wt commit -am "chore(ai): <what moved> [skip ci]"
git -C /tmp/ai-exec-wt push origin ai/execution
git worktree remove /tmp/ai-exec-wt
```
