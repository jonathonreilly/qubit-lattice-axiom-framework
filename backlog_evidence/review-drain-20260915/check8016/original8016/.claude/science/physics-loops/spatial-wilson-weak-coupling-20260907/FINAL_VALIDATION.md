# Final validation

Full pipeline **ac76c0af9030** completed against pinned main **e043c95b37bd46d80e97c39f36c8b3cb7643c62f**. Strict lint reports OK: no errors. Exactly 2 affected claim rows have forensic_evidence_ready true, with zero evidence/control failures. The generated rows have bounded_theorem type, unaudited status and nonempty declared dependencies. Readiness and rows were captured before generated cleanup.

Every relevant canonical stdout cache is present and explicitly staged. Hash-specific independent mathematical reviews and root final port review pass within the stated conditional model. All scientific parameters and frozen runner hashes remain unchanged. No audit verdict is assigned. The actual framework surface remains conditional-support.
