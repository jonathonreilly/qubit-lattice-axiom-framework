claim_scope: "For the explicit Block-48 time-reflected common-metric stationary-Schur operator, with its sign fixed so the static tensor stiffness is positive, the spatial-axis h_yz coordinate is displacement-gauge invariant. Inverting the full six-dimensional gauge quotient at k=0.4 gives the same Euclidean covariance as an independent Lagrange-bordered inverse. On each periodic-time carrier N=128,256,512,1024,2048,4096, the first one-step moment Gram [[C0,C1],[C1,C2]] and even-slice two-step moment Gram [[C0,C2],[C2,C4]] have strictly negative determinants. At N=4096 they are -0.154853981 and -0.059345208, with minimum eigenvalues -0.043916043 and -0.020538833. Thus the real positive conditional pole branches found in Block 48 do not by themselves define an action-derived positive self-adjoint one- or two-step transfer reproducing this gauge-invariant TT covariance. A positive two-atom control passes the same engine, while the first nine-slice Gram is positive; local-edge observables, alternative boundary/reflection terms, longer blocking, canonical constraint reduction, different physical field maps, unitary Lorentzian reconstruction, and nonlinear connection laws remain live. This rejects only the advertised common-metric one/two-step repair on the declared carriers. It is not a gravity no-go, all-blocking no-go, selected transfer, axiom amendment, or TOE percentage move."

# Common-Metric TT OS One/Two-Step Hankel Obstruction And Axiom Boundary

**Date:** 2026-08-11

**Type:** `bounded_theorem`

**Role:** decide whether Block 48's real tensor poles and positive decaying
numbers actually reconstruct a positive one- or two-step transfer from the
same Euclidean action, and redirect the gravity campaign if they do not.

**Audit-status authority:** independent audit lane only. This note authors no
audit verdict and predicts none.

**Primary runner:**
[admissibility_common_metric_tt_os_one_two_step_hankel_obstruction_axiom_boundary_2026_08_11.py](../scripts/admissibility_common_metric_tt_os_one_two_step_hankel_obstruction_axiom_boundary_2026_08_11.py)

## Result Up Front

The Block 48 common-metric candidate does **not** supply the physical transfer
that its real positive pole branches suggested.

At spatial momentum `q=(0.4,0,0,q_t)`, use the metric cross-polarization
coordinate `A=h_yz`. It is orthogonal to every displacement-gauge column. For
each real Euclidean `q_t`, the runner removes all four gauge directions and
inverts the complete six-dimensional quotient of the sign-fixed common-metric
operator. It does not invert the scalar pole form. An independent
Lagrange-bordered inverse agrees to `7.1e-15`.

Let `C_n` be the temporal Fourier coefficient of that action covariance. On
the `N=4096` carrier,

~~~text
(C_0,C_1,C_2,C_3,C_4)
 = (2.357705509, 1.675150736, 1.124515338,
    0.751734899, 0.511170514).                              (1)
~~~

The first one-step and even-slice two-step moment Grams are

~~~text
H_1 = [[C_0,C_1],[C_1,C_2]],
det H_1 = -0.154853981,       min eig H_1 = -0.043916043,   (2)

H_2 = [[C_0,C_2],[C_2,C_4]],
det H_2 = -0.059345208,       min eig H_2 = -0.020538833.   (3)
~~~

Both signs are already negative at `N=128` and stabilize monotonically over
`N=128,256,512,1024,2048,4096`. A positive two-atom transfer measure passes
the identical engine with determinants `0.0525` and `0.063525` for one and two
steps. Equations (2)-(3) are therefore not a pole-finder artifact or a scalar
projection artifact.

This is meaningful because if a positive self-adjoint transfer `T` reproduced
the same two-point sequence for `psi=A Omega`, then

~~~text
[C_0  C_b]   [<psi,psi>       <psi,T^b psi>]
[C_b C_2b] = [<T^b psi,psi>   <T^b psi,T^b psi>]            (4)
~~~

would be a Gram matrix for every block depth `b`. Its determinant could not be
negative. Equation (2) excludes the one-step reading; equation (3) excludes
the advertised even-slice two-step reading.

The Block 48 roots themselves remain real and their numbers `exp(-2 omega)`
remain positive. The failure is in the full covariance residues and physical
Gram, not in root location. Positive roots are necessary data, not a physical
Hilbert-space reconstruction.

This block earns **zero TOE percentage points**. It rejects the campaign's
best current transfer repair and sharpens the missing-law boundary. It does
not close gravity.

## 1. Full Gauge-Quotient Covariance

Write the Block 48 common-metric operator as `E(q)` and choose `-E(q)` so the
static TT stiffness is positive. This sign choice cannot repair a negative
two-by-two determinant: an overall covariance sign rescales that determinant
by a positive square. It is fixed here to keep the physical static convention.

At every tested mode the exact metric gauge map `G(q)` has four columns and

~~~text
E(q) G(q) = 0.                                              (5)
~~~

Choose any orthonormal basis `Q(q)` of `ker G(q)^dagger`. The six-dimensional
quotient form and observable covariance are

~~~text
K_phys(q) = -Q(q)^dagger E(q) Q(q),
g_A(q)    = u(q)^dagger K_phys(q)^-1 u(q),
u(q)      = Q(q)^dagger A.                                 (6)
~~~

The quotient inertia is `(1,5,0)` on every one of the `8,064` tested temporal
modes. The one negative direction is disclosed rather than projected away by
hand. The observable is gauge invariant to below `3e-14`, and (6) agrees with
the upper-left block of

~~~text
[ -E(q)  G(q) ]^-1
[ G(q)^dag  0  ]                                            (7)
~~~

to `7.1e-15` on an independent frequency set.

This matters: using `1/(A^dag E A)` would silently discard mixing with the
constraint/conformal sector. Equations (2)-(3) use the full inverse (6).

## 2. Finite-Carrier Result

For periodic time size `N`, the runner evaluates every frequency

~~~text
q_t = -pi + 2 pi m/N,  m=0,...,N-1,                        (8)
~~~

and computes

~~~text
C_n^(N) = (1/N) sum_m exp(i q_t n) g_A(q_t).                (9)
~~~

The determinant ranges over all six carriers are

~~~text
one step: -0.154853981 ... -0.154787529,
two step: -0.059345208 ... -0.059339148.                    (10)
~~~

The largest change in the first five moments from `N=2048` to `N=4096` is
below `1e-6`. Thus the result is a direct finite-carrier obstruction on every
declared carrier with a stable large-carrier limit, not a claim obtained by
extrapolating a fitted pole.

The common metric map used by Block 48 contains line-average factors and its
stationary nonmetric Schur complement is time-nonlocal. Those facts are not
hidden: this theorem applies to that explicit metric coordinate and operator.
It does not automatically transfer to a different local edge observable or a
different physical field map.

## 3. What The Positive Poles Did And Did Not Show

Block 48 solved the bordered determinant after the conditional continuation
`q_t=-i omega`. At `k=0.4`, both transverse parity sectors still give real
positive `omega`, hence positive numbers `exp(-2 omega)`. That establishes
candidate decay scales.

A covariance also needs nonnegative spectral weights in the physical
reflection form. Equations (2)-(3) show that the complete `h_yz` covariance
cannot be a positive moment sequence at one or two steps. The pole locations
therefore survive while their proposed action-to-Hilbert interpretation does
not.

This distinction explains why the earlier diagonal matrix made from the two
selected branch numbers was insufficient: it inserted positive weights by
construction instead of deriving them from the action covariance.

## 4. Live Repairs And The Priority Pivot

The obstruction removes one candidate, not the target. The following remain
live:

1. a **canonical constraint reduction** that solves lapse/shift and conformal
   variables before constructing the two-TT state inner product;
2. a genuinely **local edge observable** and reflection map, rather than the
   time-nonlocal common-metric coordinate;
3. an action with an exact cross-orientation coupling and a sourced
   Ricci/trace-free curvature split;
4. a derived **boundary term** or half-space normalization that changes the
   contact/residue data without changing the infrared equation;
5. **longer blocking** tied to a declared Record tick—the first nine-slice
   two-by-two determinant is `+0.000203210`, although no full nine-slice RP
   theorem is claimed;
6. a unitary Lorentzian reconstruction not obtained from this Euclidean
   common-metric covariance;
7. a nonlinear connection law whose linearized state variable differs from
   `h_yz` while retaining the Block 49 curvature/source identity.

The next high-value construction is the first route: a local two-TT canonical
transfer with explicit constraint preservation, positive inner product,
sourced Ricci contraction, trace-free state data, and one permanent-Record
step. Pole refinement, extra frequency grids, and scalar coefficient retuning
are stopped.

## 5. Exact Axiom Decision Boundary

The canonical axiom memo says directly that Admissibility is not a dynamics
axiom and does not choose a Hamiltonian or transfer operator, define a time
metric, or supply Record-production dynamics. Therefore failure of the best
current downstream transfer candidate cannot be repaired by rereading the
existing four sentences more aggressively.

Two honest outcomes remain:

- derive the canonical positive two-TT/Record update as a downstream theorem
  from an exact retained law already present elsewhere; or
- if no such law exists, **retype Admissibility** so it refers extensionally
  to one exact joint Record law `L*` (or an exact record-faithful physical-
  equivalence class), including its state/inner product, constraint update,
  clock/block depth, and Record-to-source map.

The second option is an identified constitutional cut, not a ready amendment.
A sentence saying merely “a positive transfer exists” would repeat the same
mistake as the pole argument. The referent must specify the transfer kernel or
instrument, reflection/boundary form, constraint quotient, Record step, and
source decoder sufficiently to reproduce physical probabilities.

No canonical axiom is edited in this block because that extensional referent
has not yet been derived or selected.

## Fresh No-Go-Discipline Packet

The scoped negative is: **the explicit Block 48 common-metric
stationary-Schur covariance does not admit the advertised positive
self-adjoint one- or even-slice two-step transfer representation for the
declared gauge-invariant `h_yz` observable on the six finite carriers.**

### N1 — Alternative Routes

Live routes are enumerated in Section 4: canonical constraint reduction,
local edge observable, cross-orientation coupling, boundary term, longer
blocking, unitary Lorentzian reconstruction, nonlinear connection law, and a
different physical field map. None is declared impossible.

### N2 — Wall Independence

The tested wall has four separate interfaces: the Euclidean action-to-state
map, constraint/conformal reduction, reflection/boundary form, and block-to-
Record clock identification. The first moment Gram jointly tests the first
three for the displayed coordinate; it does not select the fourth or collapse
the other law fields.

### N3 — Hidden-Wall Scan

The sign convention, `k=0.4` axis momentum, periodic time carriers,
line-average metric map, time-nonlocal stationary Schur complement,
`(1,5,0)` quotient inertia, absent Record source, and missing boundary terms
are all explicit. No continuum, local-edge, nonlinear, or infinite-volume
claim is hidden inside the finite covariance calculation.

### N4 — Residual Matching

The negative Grams match exactly Block 48's named open action-to-physical-
transfer and inner-product wall. They do not answer Block 49's nonlinear
connection, full-`Z^3`, source-allocation, or Record-step obligations.

### N5 — Resolution And Scope Certificate

The runner resolves all ten common metric coordinates through the full
six-dimensional quotient, all four gauge columns, the complete `h_yz`
observable, all `8,064` temporal modes on the six carriers, both first Hankel
blocks, two positive control atoms, both tensor poles, and the nine-slice
escape control. Per-element, per-site, per-mode, per-block, and lattice-wide
scope lines are printed in the source-pinned cache.

### N6 — Partial-Closure Scan

The exact Ward identity, real poles, infrared Einstein/TT form, Block 49 local
curvature stencil, sourced Ricci contraction, and positive canonical-transfer
control all survive. The result deletes only the claimed one/two-step
interpretation of this common-metric covariance.

### N7 — Steelman

The strongest counterposition is that the physical TT observable is a
`q_t`-dependent constrained combination or local edge curvature, and that the
correct half-space action includes a boundary normalization. That would evade
this `h_yz` Gram. It is retained as the preferred repair, but it must be
constructed explicitly; naming positive roots cannot stand in for it.

### N8 — Cross-Cycle Echo

The earlier staggered two-step work already separated decaying roots from the
CAR/OS identification. Block 48 repeated the conditional-root step on gravity;
this block performs the missing covariance Gram test. Block 49 independently
showed that the correct curvature equation must retain two trace-free/Weyl
state directions rather than delete them by homogeneous gluing.

**Status: PASS.** The one/two-step common-metric obstruction survives N1-N8.
Gravity failure, all-blocking failure, impossibility of a canonical transfer,
axiom necessity, axiom adoption, and TOE closure do not.

TOTAL: PASS=13 FAIL=0
~~~

## Conclusion

The gravity campaign was over-crediting real pole locations. The full
gauge-invariant TT covariance of the common-metric candidate has negative
one- and two-step OS moment Grams, so its positive branch numbers are not an
action-derived physical transfer.

That is significant blocker resolution, not TOE progress. The shortest path
now is a canonical constraint/state construction tied to the exact Block 49
Ricci/Weyl split and to one Record step. If that law cannot be derived, the
foundation must select it extensionally through Admissibility; another
structural existence sentence will not close the gap.
