# H1 and H2 share one five-dimensional spin-two source module, but six condition bits supply only one generic orbit

**Date:** 2026-08-29

**Type:** `bounded_theorem`
**Status:** `proposed_retained` — author-side checkpoint only.  The actual
surface is `conditional-support`; independent retained audit remains unset.

## Result in plain language

The H2 failure did not require an arbitrary enlargement.  H1 and H2 fit
exactly into the familiar five-component space of a trace-free spatial
symmetric tensor.  Under cubic symmetry it splits into a two-component
diagonal sector `E` and a three-component off-diagonal sector `T2`.  H1 uses
only `T2`; H2 uses both.  No scalar trace is needed, and the same native source
operator carries all five components without losing information.

The remaining problem is more concrete.  A generic H1 tensor has 24 distinct
cubic orientations, and so does H2.  They are different 24-member orbits.
The frozen affine action on six condition bits has 64 masks but only one free
24-member orbit.  H1 already uses it.  Every other mask orbit has a nontrivial
stabilizer and therefore cannot map equivariantly onto generic H2.  The exact
registered verdict is `MODULE-ONLY`: the common source language exists, but
the frozen six-bit condition carrier cannot name both generic source orbits
with one deterministic equivariant decoder.

This is a six-bit affine-action capacity result, not an axiom or physics
no-go.  A second physically owned free orbit remains open—for example through
an additional locally derived sector degree of freedom, a distributed
two-cell condition, or a quantum-valued corner/direction comparator.

## Exact common module

Use the upstream ten-component symmetric basis and restrict to the six purely
spatial slots `(1,2,3,7,8,9)`.  Define

```text
A1 = span{(1,1,1) on slots (1,2,3)},
E  = span{(1,-1,0),(1,1,-2) on slots (1,2,3)},
T2 = span{e_7,e_8,e_9}.                                 (1)
```

The H1 coefficient lies in `T2` and has proper-cubic cyclic-span rank three.
The H2 diagonal coefficients obey

```text
(sqrt(3)+3)/4 -(sqrt(3)+1)/4 - 1/2 = 0,                (2)
```

so H2 has no `A1` trace.  Its diagonal projection spans `E` with rank two,
and its off-diagonal projection spans `T2` with rank three.  Exact cyclic
spans give

```text
dim <G H1>              = 3,
dim <G H2>              = 5,
dim (<G H1> + <G H2>)   = 5,
dim (<G H1> intersect <G H2>) = 3.                     (3)
```

Therefore the unique smallest invariant subspace containing both complete
orbits is

```text
V_common = E direct-sum T2,       dim V_common = 5.     (4)
```

It is the trace-free spatial symmetric or spin-two module restricted to the
proper cubic group.  The phrase “spin two” identifies this representation;
it does not assert a continuum graviton or gravity closure.

## Exact cubic characters

The 24 signed proper-cubic matrices split into five conjugacy signatures.  In
the table, the signature is `(order, spatial trace, nonzero diagonal count)`.

| signature | count | chi_E | chi_T2 | chi_common |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `(1,3,3)` | 1 | 2 | 3 | 5 |
| `(2,-1,1)` | 6 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| `(2,-1,3)` | 3 | 2 | -1 | 1 |
| `(3,0,0)` | 8 | -1 | 0 | -1 |
| `(4,1,1)` | 6 | 0 | -1 | -1 |

Both runners obtain these representations from exact tensor conjugation, not
from a named character table.  The dimensions and distinct characters rule
out a four-dimensional invariant common subspace and a hidden scalar repair.

## Native source embedding

Flattening every Laurent coefficient and 16-by-16 internal entry of the ten
native action vertices gives exact rank ten in both forward and literal
actual-reverse conventions.  Restriction to (4) has rank five in both:

```text
rank(F) = rank(F_reverse) = 10,
rank(F|V_common) = rank(F_reverse|V_common) = 5.         (5)
```

The exact H1 and H2 forward and reverse sources are reproduced by their
coordinates in `V_common`.  Thus the common-module construction is positive;
the failure below belongs to the condition-domain action, not the source
operator.

## Complete 64-mask affine-action census

The frozen nontrivial affine proper-cubic action splits all 64 masks into:

| canonical representative | orbit size | stabilizer size | dim `V_common^H` | complement |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 0 | 6 | 4 | 2 | self |
| 1 | 6 | 4 | 2 | orbit 7 |
| 4 | 12 | 2 | 3 | self |
| 5 | 24 | 1 | 5 | self |
| 7 | 6 | 4 | 2 | orbit 1 |
| 12 | 2 | 12 | 0 | self |
| 21 | 4 | 6 | 1 | orbit 22 |
| 22 | 4 | 6 | 1 | orbit 21 |

The sizes sum to 64.  For an orbit `G/H`, an equivariant map into
`V_common` is determined by one seed in the fixed subspace `V_common^H`.
Summing the displayed fixed dimensions gives an exact 16-dimensional vector
space of equivariant functions on the full mask set.  The self-complement
even/odd dimensions are respectively `(1,1)`, `(1,2)`, `(3,2)`, and `(0,0)`
for representatives `0,4,5,12`; paired orbits are carried into each other.
This exhausts both parity choices without selecting one.

## Why sixteen equivariant degrees of freedom are still insufficient

The target is not merely a nonzero equivariant function.  It must contain the
complete H1 and H2 source orbits.  Both exact vectors have trivial cubic
stabilizer:

```text
|Stab(H1)| = |Stab(H2)| = 1,
|G H1| = |G H2| = 24.                                   (6)
```

They are distinct orbits because H1 has no `E` projection while H2 has a
rank-two `E` projection.  If an equivariant map sends a domain point with
stabilizer `H` to a target with stabilizer `K`, then necessarily `H` is a
subgroup of `K`.  For either generic target, `K` is trivial, so its preimage
must lie in a free domain orbit.

The census has exactly one free orbit, representative 5.  That is the frozen
H1 active orbit.  Hence:

```text
number of free domain orbits required = 2,
number of free six-bit affine orbits  = 1.               (7)
```

No deterministic equivariant map from this 64-mask `G`-set can contain both
target orbits.  This remains true even if the forty inactive zeros are allowed
to change: none of their seven orbits is free.  Preserving the complete H1
map makes a strict extension impossible immediately; allowing an explicit
replacement while preserving only the H1 active orbit still cannot place H2.
Fixture-name switching would create two maps, not one local decoder, and is
excluded by registration.

## Adjudication and physical meaning

The registered outcome is

```text
MODULE-ONLY.
```

The common five-component source representation is exact and positive.  The
frozen six-bit deterministic condition action is one generic-orbit short.
Physical local ownership is not proved: neither the six-bit map nor this note
derives how local quantum conditions prepare an H1-versus-H2 sector.

This identifies a high-leverage next target.  A second physically owned free
orbit remains open.  Candidate realizations include an additional invariant
binary sector, a two-cell distributed condition, or a quantum local variable
built from direction comparisons and corner weights.  Any such repair must
derive its value from neighboring quantum conditions; an H1/H2 label is not a
physical bit.  The next campaign must preregister and compare those owners
before constructing a common decoder.

In the exact controlled wording used by the runners, a second physically owned free orbit remains open, and physical local ownership is not proved.

## No-Go Discipline Gate

The committed
[N1--N8 checklist](../.claude/science/physics-loops/toe-source-eta-ownership-block08-common-spin2-module-20260829/NO_GO_DISCIPLINE_CHECKLIST.md)
passes only for the six-bit affine-action capacity statement.  It explicitly
keeps enlarged alphabets, multi-cell conditions, and quantum-valued inputs
open.  The load-bearing wall is one orbit-count mismatch, not independent
module/source/carrier/history failures.  The primary cache includes the five
required `per_element:`, `per_site:`, `per_mode:`, `per_block:`, and
`lattice_wide:` lines.

## TOE accounting

This is real route progress: the H1/H2 representation gap is closed exactly,
and the next missing physical object is localized to one additional owned
generic condition orbit.  It does not retire a formal obligation because no
single locally prepared common law has survived end to end.

```text
minimal common source module: E direct-sum T2, dimension 5
native source embedding:      exact and injective
frozen six-bit compiler:      absent
verdict:                      MODULE-ONLY
physical local ownership:     open
carrier/history/rate/clock:   not reached
axiom update:                 false
obligation retirement: 0
TOE percentage movement: 0
retained status:              unset
```

No axiom amendment is indicated.  The deficit is an extensional local
condition carrier with insufficient orbit capacity, and ordinary larger or
quantum-owned carriers remain allowed by the current axioms.
