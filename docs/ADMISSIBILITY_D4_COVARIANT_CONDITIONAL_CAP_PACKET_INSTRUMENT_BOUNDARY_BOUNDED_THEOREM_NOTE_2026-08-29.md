## 1. Result up front

The registered terminal is
**`COVARIANT-CONDITIONAL-CAP-PACKET-INSTRUMENT`**.

One **common cubic-invariant blank input** feeds **one total covariant
instrument**.  Its six equal outcomes write the six symmetry-related gapped
Record caps, two-Record seeds, and live packets.  The input contains no front,
cap, branch precursor, site role, epoch, tape, scheduler, or same-event
outcome.  The realized Record mask carries the output direction.

Every branch is a positive normalized quantum state, the six branch effects
sum exactly to the blank-sector identity, and the complementary STOP channel
is identity on every nonblank Record sector.  Every generated branch then has
one flag-only forward tip and composes exactly with the frozen Block-15
fourteen-outcome all-or-none controller.

This closes the effective common-input writer existence question, but only
**conditional on a selected center** and occurrence of an **atomic
radius-three block channel**.  The channel prepares the complete desired
targets by trace-and-prepare; it does not derive their preparation mechanism.
The writer occupies 43 sites, while its first controller step requires a
73-site extension because all five post-writer destinations lie outside the
writer block.  **nearest-neighbor compilation remains open**.

A second exact result shows that **one-site marginals do not select the joint
writer**: a correlated six-configuration law makes a valid writer with
probability one, while the product of the same one-site marginals makes one
with probability `5^15/6^18<1`.  This is a classical preparation-label model,
not a claim that nonorthogonal local density matrices are perfectly
distinguishable by a Born measurement.

Accounting is unchanged: **obligation retirement: 0** and **TOE percentage
movement: 0**.  No minimal-axiom edit is warranted by this author-side finite
existence result.

Machine-checkable scope summary: one common cubic-invariant blank input enters
one total covariant instrument; the result is conditional on a selected center
and an atomic radius-three block channel; nearest-neighbor compilation remains
open; one-site marginals do not select the joint writer; obligation retirement:
0; TOE percentage movement: 0.

## 2. Effective algebra and total instrument

For the six signed coordinate directions `D`, take the proper-cubic-invariant
centered writer support

```text
B = union over f in D of
    {-2f,-f,0,f,2f,3f}
    union {2f+e : e perpendicular to f}.
```

The union has exactly

```text
1 center + 18 nonzero axial sites + 24 off-axis sites = 43 sites.
```

The effective algebra is the direct sum over all permanent-Record masks
`S subset B`, with one `M_2(C)` factor at every site inside each mask sector.
Blank means only `S=empty`; its quantum contents may be arbitrary.  Record-mask
coherences are absent on this declared classical-quantum domain.

Let `Pi_blank` project onto the no-Record summand.  For each `f`, let `sigma_f`
be the target branch state described below.  The fixed instrument is

```text
Phi_f(X)    = Tr(Pi_blank X) sigma_f / 6,
Phi_STOP(X) = Pi_nonblank X Pi_nonblank.
```

Each write branch is CP because its Choi operator is the tensor product of two
positive operators,

```text
J_f = Pi_blank^T tensor sigma_f / 6.
```

Its effect is `Pi_blank/6`; the six effects sum to `Pi_blank`.  STOP has effect
`Pi_nonblank`, so the total effect is identity on every one of the `2^43`
mask sectors.  STOP preserves every nonblank sector and all of its contents.
A full-Hilbert extension may dephase blank/nonblank coherences; the registered
direct-sum domain contains no such coherences.

This is an effective CP/TP certificate without constructing matrices of
dimension `2^43`.  The factorization and the symbolic empty/nonempty mask split
prove the full declared domain exactly.

## 3. Six exact outputs

For each signed axis `f`, use the equivariant outcome `a(f)=f` and frozen
Record Bloch vector

```text
r_f = record_code(f,f) = -(143/256) f.
```

The one-site density matrix `rho(r_f)` has exact eigenvalues

```text
113/512 and 399/512,
```

so it is strictly positive and normalized.  The branch places permanent
Records exactly at `-2f,0,f`, all carrying `r_f`; leaves the required gap
`-f` and candidate `2f` without Records; places live non-Record content `r_f`
at `3f`; and places zero Bloch content on the four transverse sources
`2f+e` and every other non-Record site.

Thus the six neighbors of the next candidate `2f` are exactly the frozen
`M=0` hybrid shell.  The complete branch is a normalized product state.  The
six Record masks are distinct and therefore orthogonal in the declared
Record-mask direct sum.  Their quantum contents alone are not asserted to be
orthogonal.

## 4. Covariance and oracle surface

All 24 proper cubic rotations permute `B`, map the branch mask for `f` to the
mask for `Qf`, and map every Bloch vector in `sigma_f` to the corresponding
vector in `sigma_(Qf)`.  Since every blank branch has the same effect
`Pi_blank/6`, the instrument obeys

```text
alpha_Q o Phi_f = Phi_(Qf) o alpha_Q,
alpha_Q o Phi_STOP = Phi_STOP o alpha_Q.
```

Translations give the corresponding family of centered blocks; they do not
make one fixed finite support translation-invariant.

The public constructor receives only the centered block's Record flags and
quantum contents.  On a blank mask it returns all six outcomes of the one
instrument; on a nonblank mask it returns identity/STOP.  Source and AST checks
exclude a public front, center coordinate, branch-specific precursor, role,
epoch, tape, scheduler, lookup table, or same-event probability feedback.

The center is nevertheless selected outside this constructor by choosing
where the centered block channel is applied.  That is an explicit condition,
not a hidden input parameter.

## 5. Exact Block-15 composition and support correction

For each generated mask `{-2f,0,f}`, the complete Record frontier has exactly
one eligible site, `2f`, and internally infers `f`.  The rear gap, cap exterior,
and lateral/cap candidates fail.  The `M=0` shell gives the exact normalized
positive fourteen-outcome distribution.

The direct controller census covers

```text
6 branches * 14 outcomes * 32 destination-obstacle masks = 2,688 maps.
```

All 84 clear maps produce the exact successor packet.  All 2,604 blocked maps
are identity on the five sources and five destinations and preserve occupied
Records.  Across the six generated length-two seeds and 31 nonempty masks,
all 186 post-event blocked components have zero eligible continuation in
5,166 complete-frontier evaluations.

The independently discovered support distinction is load-bearing.  At
candidate `2f`, the five sources

```text
3f and 2f+e
```

lie in `B`, but the five destinations

```text
4f and 3f+e
```

do not.  Their union over six fronts adds 30 distinct sites, so direct
composition acts on a 73-site tensor extension.  The instrument itself remains
a 43-site writer.

The inherited Block-15 regression separately checks 2,976 blocked components
over trail lengths two through seventeen and 171,936 frontier evaluations.
Those are valid regression cases; only 186 are generated directly from the
Block-16 length-two outputs.

## 6. One-site marginals versus a joint writer

Let `C_f` denote the complete local preparation-label configuration for branch
`f`, and define

```text
P_corr(C_f) = 1/6.
```

At each of the 43 sites, take the exact one-site marginal of this correlated
law and form their independent product `P_prod`.  Direct reconstruction checks
all 66 distinct site-label marginal entries.  Every marginal is normalized,
and the product law reproduces each one exactly.

Each valid `C_f` contains four local labels of marginal probability `1/6` and
fifteen blank labels of marginal probability `5/6`; all other factors are one.
The six valid configurations are distinct, hence

```text
P_corr(valid) = 1,
P_prod(valid) = 6 (1/6)^4 (5/6)^15 = 5^15/6^18 < 1.
```

The conclusion is narrow.  Neighbor-determined one-site distributions do not,
without an additional consistency/process theorem, specify this finite
43-site correlation.  The countermodel does not rule out a stochastic local
process, sequential compiler, common environment, or another physical
principle that selects the correlated law.  Its labels include exact Bloch
preparations; the rational is not a Born probability for perfectly
distinguishing nonorthogonal density matrices.

## 7. What the result buys

Block 15 supplied an oriented cap and proved propagation.  Block 16 removes
the cap and direction from the **input state of the conditioned effective
event**: one symmetric blank-sector effect produces all six orientations with
equal weights, and the realized Record sector carries the choice.  It also
proves that CP, normalization, cubic covariance, Record permanence, and the
existing propagation controller are mutually compatible.

That is a genuine finite-channel bridge, but not yet the physical law we need.
Trace-and-prepare can wrap any finite covariant target ensemble.  Here the
whole desired geometry and content are encoded in the six target states
`sigma_f`; the construction therefore moves the import from a supplied
oriented cap to a supplied atomic preparation table and environment.  It is an
existence and interface theorem, not a derivation of Nature's writer.

The next high-leverage question is consequently sharper than before: can this
43-site trace-and-prepare instrument be compiled from one fixed normalized
nearest-neighbor rule on ordinary one-site carriers, including the Record-mask
detector, environment, 73-site controller extension, and conflict handling?
An exact positive compiler would make the writer mechanistic.  An exact
obstruction would identify which requirement must change.

## 8. Exact claim boundary

Established author-side:

1. one common blank-sector input effect and one six-output CP/TP instrument;
2. exact proper-cubic covariance and a translated family of centered blocks;
3. six physical 43-site outputs with exact cap, seed, gap, and `M=0` packet;
4. no public front/cap/branch/role/clock oracle in the constructor;
5. exact composition in all 2,688 controller maps on a 73-site extension;
6. zero continuation in 186 generated and 2,976 inherited blocked components;
7. an exact same-one-site-marginals/different-joint finite countermodel.

Not established:

1. derivation or unique selection of the target preparation table from the
   minimal axioms;
2. a microscopic blank/Record detector, reset environment, or nearest-neighbor
   circuit implementing the atomic channel;
3. simultaneous or overlapping-center arbitration and a global update law;
4. selection of the event center, occurrence hazard, physical rate, or clock;
5. a conserved source/action join to connection, gravity, continuum limits,
   or phenomenology;
6. axiom sufficiency, axiom amendment, independent audit retention, obligation
   retirement, TOE closure, or any formal score change.

No universal locality, dynamics, formation, gravity, or axiom no-go is
claimed.  These are unexecuted obligations, not impossibility theorems.

## 9. Axiom and portfolio implication

The current minimal axioms already say that one fixed nearest-neighbor rule
determines a sitewise probability distribution and that Records form and lock
one supported result.  They do not provide the distribution's extensional
form, a center/rate rule, a joint process, a Record-production mechanism, or a
Hamiltonian/transfer operator.  Block 16 neither contradicts that boundary nor
shows it must be enlarged.

No axiom update is justified.  The correct next campaign is an import-
retirement attempt: compile or obstruct the present finite writer using a
normalized local instrument with explicit overlap semantics.  Occurrence/time
should follow a coherent concurrent process; gravity should re-enter when a
conserved physical source can be extracted from that process.  Repeating more
finite trace-and-prepare tables would be low leverage.
