# Full Temporal Carrier, Conditioned History, And Source-Typing Boundary

## 1. Result Up Front

Block 192 repairs the carrier and static-history gaps left by Block 191, then
finds a different first empty arrow.

The canonical minimal uniform realization is an exact periodic temporal
carrier with `L=24` that contains both frozen temporal sectors, implements the
`pi/12` X1 recoil locally, intertwines
all twelve incoming/outgoing action modes, and is closed by reflection.  On
that carrier, the honest ordinary-transpose reflected-even Schur Gram is
strictly positive at every frozen spatial radius.  Exact symmetries force its
internal marginal to be `I_16/16`; conditioning on a frozen grade-three effect
gives `E_st/4`.  The adjacent write's isometry and effect correlations imply
the lifted positive-congruence principle; the runner does not instantiate the
full written Gram.

The static conditioned state therefore reproduces Block 191's external
expectation

\[
 C_{st,A}=\operatorname{Tr}\!\left[
   \left({E_{st}\over4}-{I\over16}\right)V_A
 \right].
\]

That equality is not a source-response theorem.  If the momentum-changing
vertex is embedded diagnostically as an endomorphism of the incoming spatial
fiber, the Schur graph and honest Gram can be recomputed and the logarithm of
the normalized branch weight differentiated.  This same-fiber proxy
susceptibility is not `C`: at D1 two nonzero components require incompatible
normalizations, while at H1 `C` is exactly zero and the proxy susceptibility is
exactly nonzero.

The physical typing is now explicit.  The Block-191 vertex is a transition
coherence between incoming and outgoing momentum sectors.  A frozen diagonal
outcome event cannot see such an off-diagonal tangent at first order.  A
response-sensitive coherent event may evade that parity orthogonality, but the
runner's displayed scalar-phase projector is certified only as a positive
instrument effect: its overlap with the instantiated raw vertex tangent is
zero, and the propagated two-sector Gram tangent is not executed here.  Any
successful coherent law must therefore derive whatever internal orientation
and relative phase it uses from physical clock, detector, or writer data
rather than fit them to the response.

This is a narrow incompatibility of the same-fiber proxy, normalized
branch-weight observable, and Schur port, followed by an exact typing theorem
for the physical two-sector source.  It is not a history, gravity, Record, or
TOE no-go.  No TOE score moves.

## 2. Authority And Frozen Scope

The runner binds:

- `origin/main` at `b11811704efa98a12272d572f666e530a807f6c1`;
- the current [minimal axioms](MINIMAL_AXIOMS_2026-06-29.md), byte-identical in
  the worktree and on current main;
- the exact Block-191 parent commit
  `480f633a5fbe34f444ec57e079abdd81b42e7728`; and
- the pre-target route order at commit
  `d1f55e02b1e8750165682156dbbc3b021ec3bb00`.

Current main's premise registry and the older stacked worktree registry are
pinned separately.  The latter still contains superseded additive-readout
wording inherited from the open stack; this theorem does not use it.  All
foundation claims use the current minimal-axiom text, which supplies a
neighbor-conditioned probability distribution and fixed Record locking but
does not supply its values, an event basis, a source/action bridge, formation
rate, or realized-outcome selection rule.

The mass `m=2/7`, points D1--D3/H1--H2/X1, discovery/held-out split, effects,
source vertices, reflection, cut, event normalization, write, and three
carrier families were frozen before target execution.  No point-dependent
coupling, response-selected event, fitted normalization, new momentum, or
post-failure source counts as success.

## 3. Minimal Common Temporal Carrier

Let `U` be the periodic shift on 24 sites and

\[
 D={U-U^T\over2},\qquad
 f_k(t)={e^{-ikt}\over\sqrt{24}}.
\]

Then `Df_k=i sin(k)f_k`.  The modes `pi/6` and `pi/4` occur at Fourier indices
two and three.  With `q=pi/12`,

\[
 M_qf_k=f_{k+q},\qquad
 M_qUM_q^\dagger=e^{-iq}U.
\]

The Weyl relation gives an orbit of 24 distinct translation characters, so
any finite Weyl-covariant carrier has dimension divisible by 24.  A standard
twisted or antiperiodic uniform circle cannot contain both frozen modes;
`L=24` periodic time is the smallest uniform local realization.

The midpoint link

\[
 V_t(q)={e^{iq/2}\over2}(M_qU+U^\dagger M_q)
\]

obeys

\[
 V_t(q)f_k=\cos(k+q/2)f_{k+q},
\]

including the X1 coefficient `cos(5 pi/24)`.  The full 16-form action

\[
 A=I_{24}\otimes(mI+iS_{\rm sp})+D\otimes\Gamma_t
\]

matches the Block-190 incoming and outgoing action at all twelve endpoints.
Temporal reflection reverses the action and maps
`E_st -> E_-s,-t`; the midpoint rephasing removes the harmless link phase.

The exact four-mode `D_*` control contains the two spectral magnitudes and has
a positive same-sector raw Gram, but its algebra preserves the two
frequency-magnitude sectors.  It cannot implement the X1 Weyl modulation
without a point-selected partial isometry.  Likewise `L4_AP direct-sum L6_AP`
is a reducible spectral control, not one local recoil carrier.

## 4. Honest Reflected History And Static Conditioning

For the first-half cut `N=0,...,11`, write the action in `N/P` blocks and set

\[
 V_R=E_N-E_Pd^{-1}c,\qquad
 H=V_R^TA^{-1}V_R,\qquad G_{\rm OS}=H+H^\dagger.
\]

The transpose in `H` is the ordinary transpose.  Replacing it by a Hermitian
adjoint constructs a different polar control and is not the physical object
tested here.

The runner verifies at all twelve endpoints that the spatial Clifford vector
squares to `r I_16`, is traceless, anticommutes with `Gamma_t`, and that
`Gamma_t` is a traceless involution.  The full exterior action therefore
reduces to eight equivalent two-component Clifford blocks.  A no-pivot exact
LDL calculation over
`K[j]/(j^2+r)` tests the nine unique frozen spatial radii

\[
 0,{3\over4},1,{5\over4},{3\over2},2,3,
 {7+\sqrt3\over4},{10+\sqrt3\over4}.
\]

Every reduced Gram has 24 positive pivots.  Thus its reduced inertia is
`(24,0,0)` and the full-16 inertia is `(192,0,0)` at every frozen radius.  The
smallest numerical LDL pivot in the entire frozen set is approximately
`0.1274786927`.  This is a finite frozen-set theorem, not an all-`m,r`
positivity theorem.

Two exact symmetries descend through the Schur graph.  The runner checks them
with symbolic spatial magnitude, not only at the displayed `r=1` fixture.  A
unitary temporal parity paired with the spatial Clifford involution and an
antiunitary time-Clifford symmetry force every local internal block to be
scalar.  The runner solves the generic two-by-two Hermitian fixed algebra and
finds only scalar matrices.  The copy-blind exterior algebra then gives

\[
 {\operatorname{Tr}_{\rm time}G_{\rm OS}\over
  \operatorname{Tr}G_{\rm OS}}={I_{16}\over16}.
\]

For `F_st=I_12 tensor E_st`, each branch weight is `1/4` and

\[
 \rho_{st}={\operatorname{Tr}_{\rm time}(F_{st}G_{\rm OS}F_{st})
             \over\operatorname{Tr}(F_{st}G_{\rm OS}F_{st})}
           ={E_{st}\over4}.
\]

This proves the static Gram-derived state closure.  It does not prove that the
vertex is the derivative of this Gram or that the four effects are the
physical local-possibility partition.

## 5. Same-Fiber Proxy Response Falsifiers

For a diagnostic only, embed the frozen momentum-changing Block-190 vertex as
an endomorphism of the incoming 16-dimensional spatial fiber.  This is not a
spatial translation carrier and not the physically typed
`p direct-sum (p+q)` source used in Section 6.  With the proxy deformation
`A(epsilon)=A+epsilon dot A`, differentiate the closed graph:

\[
 \dot V_R=-E_Pd^{-1}E_P^T\dot A\,V_R,
 \qquad \dot Y=-A^{-1}\dot A A^{-1}.
\]

For `H=V_R^TYV_R`,

\[
 \dot H=\dot V_R^TYV_R+V_R^T\dot YV_R+V_R^TY\dot V_R.
\]

For `G=H+H^dagger`, define

\[
 Z=\operatorname{Tr}G,\qquad
 Z_E=\operatorname{Tr}(FG),\qquad
 p_E={Z_E\over Z}={1\over4},
\]

and the logarithmic branch susceptibility

\[
 R_E={d\over d\epsilon}\log p_E\bigg|_0
    ={\dot Z_E\over Z_E}-{\dot Z\over Z}.
\]

The probability derivative itself is `dot p_E=R_E/4`.  D1 below uses the
complexified holomorphic part of this same `A+epsilon dot A` convention; H1
uses the full doubled `G` response.

### D1: no universal normalization

Even after admitting both real source quadratures and complexifying the
honest OS holomorphic tangent, D1 branch `(-- )` already fails proportionality.
For zero-based components `A=2` and `A=9`, Block 191 gives

\[
 C_2={i\over4},\qquad C_9=-{\sqrt2\over8}.
\]

The exact `A+epsilon dot A` holomorphic responses require the normalizations

\[
 \alpha_2=-
 {88042789399118666906877625204910788\over
  50293412165579896956069392595363895}
 =-1.7505829413\ldots,
\]

\[
 \alpha_9=-
 {88042789399118666906877625204910788\over
  118579089902841470734642733193729647}
 =-0.7424815747\ldots.
\]

They are unequal.  Equivalently, the exact cross residual is

\[
 C_2R_9-C_9R_2=
 {8535709717157696722321667574795719\sqrt2\,i\over
  352171157596474667627510500819643152}\ne0.
\]

A common scale, sign, or phase therefore cannot repair even the discovery
point.

### H1: zero/nonzero discovery support mismatch

At H1, branch `(-- )`, zero-based component `A=8=(0,2)`,

\[
 C_{--,8}=0,
\]

while differentiating the normalized doubled proxy Gram gives the log
susceptibility

\[
 R_{{\rm OS},--,8}=
 -{60152486349300630788094853463157702307183068975741688011109\sqrt6
 \over
 1367578267202679321096642792688675885888759047856166126012160}
 =-0.107740011558\ldots.
\]

The runner derives this value from the exact tensor-factorized Schur
derivative.  Deleting the zero-frequency vertex term makes it exactly zero,
providing an algebraic proxy falsifier rather than a numerical comparison.

No continuous-time or globally translation-covariant source-response claim is
made.  Both remain open.

## 6. Event-Typing Theorem

The runner instantiates this sector algebra with the actual nonzero H1
Block-190 vertex and the actual `E_--` effect.  It forms a Hermitian
32-dimensional transition pair from that vertex and its adjoint in the
off-diagonal blocks, not an arbitrary scalar toy.  The actual reverse
Block-190 vertex is related by the graded parity convention and is not claimed
to equal that adjoint.

Let the unperturbed incoming/outgoing action, graph, and Gram be block
diagonal in sector parity while the source tangent is block off-diagonal.  If
the frozen event `F` commutes with sector parity, then

\[
 \operatorname{Tr}(F\dot G)=0,
 \qquad \operatorname{Tr}\dot G=0.
\]

Therefore a diagonal Lüders event has zero first-order response to a pure
transition-coherence source.  The runner also constructs the positive
projector family

\[
 F_\phi={1\over2}
 \begin{pmatrix}
 E & e^{i\phi}E\\
 e^{-i\phi}E & E
 \end{pmatrix},
\]

and its positive complement.  For the instantiated raw vertex tangent
`T_raw`, however, `Tr(F_phi T_raw)=0` for every `phi`; this family is a positivity
certificate, not a response certificate.  The pure off-diagonal readout is
indefinite.  A response-sensitive coherent effect could instead require a
nontrivial internal partial-isometry orientation within `ran(E)`, or could
respond after the full two-sector Schur propagation, but neither construction
is executed here.  This theorem identifies the first physical typing choice;
it does not rule out deriving the necessary orientation and phase reference
from a complete detector, clock, or Record law.

## 7. Reflection And Write Boundary

Canonical temporal reflection maps `E_st` to `E_-s,-t`, so the graded outcome
relabel has structural support.  The separately Hermitianized Block-191
response is a response-phase convention, not a competing OS adjoint; neither
convention turns the same-fiber proxy into a physical translation carrier or
selects a coherent event.

The joint-effect write `W` remains an isometry.  For each branch,

\[
 W\rho_{st}W^\dagger\succeq0
\]

and the output lies in the matching pointer support.  Because
`W^dagger W=I`, the lifted map `I_12 tensor W` preserves positivity by
congruence and transports any tangent linearly.  The runner proves this
general principle from the internal isometry and effect correlations; it does
not instantiate the lifted full Gram or its tangent.  This is an adjacent
algebraic write, not a derivation of formation, amplification, physical
readability, or permanent Record dynamics.

## 8. No-Go Discipline Gate

This gate returns **FAIL for any broad source, history, gravity, Record, or TOE
no-go**.  The result is demoted to a narrow
`partial-attempt-with-honest-residual`: the executed same-fiber proxy and
ordinary-transpose Schur log susceptibility are incompatible, while the
physically typed two-sector source has zero diagonal first-order response.

### N1 -- normalized alternative-route enumeration

| family | object / mechanism / terminal obligation | marker | outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| periodic local Fourier carrier/history | `L=24` Weyl representation / local shift, reflection, and exact LDL / common positive frozen history | ATTEMPTED | carrier and all-nine-radius history succeed; event/source law remains |
| minimal four-mode spectral carrier | real `D_*` / exact two-frequency spectrum and reflection / X1 local recoil closure | ATTEMPTED | positive same-sector control; Weyl orbit forces dimension 24 |
| static conditioned-state bridge | honest OS Gram / symmetry-forced `E_st/4` / reproduce the external Block-191 expectation | ATTEMPTED | reproduces `C` exactly as a static expectation, not as a derivative |
| same-fiber proxy response | incoming-fiber endomorphism / exact Schur differentiation / reproduce `C` by one normalization | ATTEMPTED | D1 requires unequal normalizations and H1 has a zero/nonzero residual |
| typed two-sector diagonal event | Hermitian pair built from the actual H1 vertex / sector-parity trace orthogonality / nonzero physical first-order response | ATTEMPTED | the off-diagonal source is nonzero but every diagonal event response is zero |

Live, untested families include a phase-referenced coherent event, another
action-native observable or source, a second-order diagonal rate, a
continuous-time response law, reducible AP controls, and a full spacetime
detector/readout.  They are not counted as attempted or ruled out.  Their
existence forbids a broader no-go.

### N2 -- collapsed wall-dependence audit

Use the sequential condition set:

- `W1`: select or derive a physical event/source interface, including any
  required internal orientation and phase reference;
- `W2`: prove that interface's actual normalized history response equals the
  matter-source tensor on the frozen set and then its stated domain; and
- `W3`: compose the selected response into a physical permanent Record law.

| pair | closing first closes second? | closing second closes first? | disposition |
|---|---|---|---|
| W1, W2 | no | yes, because a genuine W2 names and validates its event/source interface | W1 is an upstream part of W2, not an independent wall |
| W1, W3 | no | yes, because a genuine W3 composition identifies its event/source interface | W1 is upstream of W3 |
| W2, W3 | no | yes, because the claimed W3 composition presupposes a validated response | W3 is downstream, not independent |

The carrier and frozen-set positivity conditions are positively repaired in
this block.  They are not inflated into surviving walls.  The collapsed first
open condition is the physical event/source interface and its response law.

### N3 -- hidden-condition scan

The phrases `canonical`, `registered`, `by construction`, `naturally`, and
`actual Gram` were re-audited.  `Canonical` means only the frozen local Fourier
carrier and temporal link; the D1/H1 deformation is explicitly a same-fiber
proxy, not a global source.  `Registered` refers only to the frozen
grade-three PVM, not an axiom-selected measurement.  The write
correlation holds by its displayed isometry but carries no formation or
persistence dynamics.  Transition coherence is the algebraic sector type of
the vertex, not proof that nature uses the coherent event.  `Actual Gram`
means the ordinary-transpose Schur object, not the positive polar control.

Positive mass `2/7`, finite `L=24`, the first-half cut, nine frozen radii,
linear response, one selected PVM, one source assembly, and the adjacent write
are explicit scope conditions.  The branch-local premise registry contains
superseded additive-readout wording; it is pinned but unused.  No hidden
axiom, internal event orientation, phase reference, measurement rule, or
all-radius positivity theorem is imported.

### N4 -- exact residual matching

| cited witness | witness residual | present residual | match? |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Block 191](ADMISSIBILITY_D4_GRADE3_SOURCE_INSTRUMENT_HISTORY_WRITE_BOUNDARY_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-24.md), lines 45--59 | `L=4_AP` cannot carry held-out `pi/6` source modes | common temporal carrier | yes; `L=24` repairs this exact residual |
| [Block 191](ADMISSIBILITY_D4_GRADE3_SOURCE_INSTRUMENT_HISTORY_WRITE_BOUNDARY_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-24.md), lines 264--265 | trace response is not yet a realized source | proxy susceptibility differs and physical two-sector diagonal response vanishes | partial; it motivates the test but does not prove either current certificate |
| [Block 190](ADMISSIBILITY_D4_DIRAC_KAHLER_COMMON_ACTION_WARD_TT_RECORD_MARK_BOUNDARY_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-24.md), lines 428--441 | missing physical source/state/context/write on one action | physical event/source typing after carrier repair | partial; current result sharpens only that first interface |
| [Block 128](ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_CURVED_CARRIER_DEPENDENCY_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-17.md), lines 55--67 | no common global curved action in its shifted-chart package | flat periodic event/source typing | no; dropped as witness support and retained only as an untested fallback family |

The H1 exact fraction, D1 cross residual, and sector-parity trace theorem are
self-contained current certificates.  No nonmatching prior no-go is used as
support.

### N5 -- resolution and rhetoric audit

per_element: checked full exterior Clifford generators, fixed grade-three effects, and conditioned write correlations.

per_site: checked the local L24 shift/link law, edge reflection, half-cut Schur graph, and lifted write-congruence principle.

per_mode: checked all twelve D1-D3/H1-H2/X1 carrier endpoints, all six Block-191 source invariants, all nine exact spatial radii, and same-fiber proxy susceptibilities only at discovery points D1/H1.

per_block: checked the periodic L24 carrier, four-mode control, reflected positive history, static conditioning, D1/H1 same-fiber proxy response, actual two-sector event typing, and write principle as distinct blocks.

lattice_wide: checked and not executed — no full spatial lattice, general continuous-time law, nonlinear gravity, Born derivation, permanent Record dynamics, or retained TOE theory is claimed.

The negative statement is per-mode and per-block only for the D1/H1 discovery
proxy and for diagonal first-order readout of the instantiated two-sector
vertex.  No held-out susceptibility, continuous-time law, lattice-wide source,
or all-observable negative is stated.

### N6 -- partial-closure and axiom scan

The current premise registry and minimal-axiom source were read directly.
Admissibility supplies that neighboring conditions determine a probability
distribution over possibilities, while Record supplies single-possibility
locking and permanence once a Record is present.  They do not select the
grade-three PVM, a coherent internal orientation or phase, a source/action identification, the
distribution's values, formation site/rate, or a response observable.  The
approved scale-reference, kinetic-isotropy, and realized-state primitives do
not supply those bridges either.

Static conditioned-state closure, the positive coherent-event construction, graded
outcome transport, and alternative response conventions are partial-closure
routes.  The current coherent family is not a demonstrated response.  An
orientation and phase could be derived from a complete clock/detector rather
than axiomatized.  Current evidence therefore justifies neither editing the
minimal axioms nor asserting that a new axiom is required.  The methodology's
referenced `feedback_no_new_axioms.md` is absent from this worktree and current
main; the live registry, minimal-axiom qualification, and registered primitive
sources govern this classification.

### N7 -- hostile steelman

A hostile reviewer should reject any broader obstruction.  The diagonal-event
trace theorem almost advertises its own escape: propagate the actual
two-sector Schur tangent and test a positive coherent incoming/outgoing event
whose internal orientation and phase are derived from the same physical clock
or pointer, without a fitted normalization.  Alternatively, derive an action-native observable for
which the Block-191 tensor is a static conditional expectation rather than a
linear probability derivative, or test the first nonzero second-order
diagonal rate.  Each route has a concrete terminal obligation and none is
closed here.  This steelman forces the partial-attempt classification.

### N8 -- cross-cycle echo

Block 190's derivative-blind context was repaired by the grade-three PVM.
Block 191's apparent temporal-carrier wall was repaired here by the `L=24`
Weyl carrier.  Its normalized-state coincidence, however, concealed the next
source-typing interface.  Earlier raw-cut indefiniteness was also replaced by a
positive reflected-even Schur port.  These repeated mechanism changes show
that local walls can retire without an axiom amendment and make any broad
source/history no-go premature.  The same repair mechanisms motivate the
propagated coherent-event and alternative-observable successor campaign.

The highest-leverage successor is no longer another carrier or positivity
scan.  It should hold the successful `L=24` carrier, action, cut, clock,
formation condition, and write fixed, then execute two complete event laws:

1. a diagonal Admissibility/Record probability law, including its first
   nonzero response order; and
2. a positive coherent transition-event law whose response is computed from
   the propagated physical tangent and whose internal orientation and relative
   phase are supplied by a physical clock, detector, or writer rather than
   fitted per point.

Each law must run from neighboring condition through probability distribution,
realized event, write, and permanent readable Record.  A discriminator must
compare unrefitted predictions on a held-out source.  Only two complete,
admissible, Record-distinguishable survivors can make a minimal-axiom choice
eligible.  Failure of one construction is not such a result.
