Separately, the grade-three PVM has four positive rank-four effects, candidate Tr(rho E) weights 1/4 for rho=I/16, exact conditioned Ward/recoil cancellation, and a derivative-sensitive TT response candidate of rank two on three discovery and two held-out points. These branches are not a common-action chain: the four-slice AP temporal spectrum has sin^2(k_t)=1/2, whereas both held-outs have k_t=pi/6 and sin^2(k_t)=1/4. Their incoming and outgoing Block-190 polar scalars differ from the AP history scalar by exactly -1/4, so any held-out action intertwiner is zero. Equality of the normalized local densities I/16 does not repair that parent-action mismatch, and no full 16-form history intertwiner or source-conditioned written history is executed. Ordinary same-label response reality fails by a sign; form parity with outcome transport and the Hermitianized derivative response are two distinct exact downstream conventions, both unadmitted.

# Four-Dimensional Grade-Three Response, Reduced History, And Write Boundary

**Date:** 2026-08-24

**Campaign block:** 191

**Type:** `bounded_theorem`

**Standing:** proposed bounded theorem; independent audit unset

Primary runner:
[`admissibility_d4_grade3_source_instrument_history_write_2026_08_24.py`](../scripts/admissibility_d4_grade3_source_instrument_history_write_2026_08_24.py).

## 1. Corrected Result Up Front

Block 191 does **not** join one action, source, history, and write.  It proves
three useful but separate pieces:

1. a reduced four-slice antiperiodic Dirac--Kahler history has a displayed
   strictly positive reflection-even doubled Schur port;
2. a frozen grade-three PVM supplies positive candidate weights and a
   conserved derivative-sensitive rank-two TT response on discovery and
   held-out momenta; and
3. its joint-projector write is an isometry and preserves an unconditioned
   maximally mixed boundary state by congruence.

The first cross-piece arrow is empty.  Every temporal mode of the four-slice
AP history obeys `sin^2(k_t)=1/2`.  Both load-bearing held-outs instead use
`k_t=pi/6`, hence `sin^2(k_t)=1/4`.  Their Block-190 action and the AP history
therefore have different polar scalars at both transition endpoints.  No
nonzero action intertwiner can connect them.

The normalized local states happen to be `I_16/16` on both sides.  That
coincidence previously hid the mismatch; equality after normalization is not
an intertwiner between the parent actions.  The runner now checks the exact
spectral residual before classifying either reverse convention or the write.

This correction moves the first empty interface earlier than ordinary
reverse-momentum reality.  Reverse reality remains informative downstream:

- exterior-form parity plus `(s,t)->(-s,-t)` restores exact conjugate reality;
- independently, `X=-i(V-mH)` restores ordinary same-label reality when the
  recoil Ward terms are rephased with it.

Those are distinct candidate conventions.  Neither fixes the temporal
carrier.  The next campaign must construct an explicit full-fiber temporal
carrier/intertwiner and compose the source insertion into its reflected Gram
before selecting between them.

No TOE score moves.  The result is a corrected partial attempt with an exact
residual, not a physical source, Record law, axiom issue, or broad no-go.

## 2. Authority And Frozen Scope

The executable binds:

- `origin/main` at `c79384cb8ffa27fcb53cb89c53a84a708442eaad`;
- the unchanged [minimal axioms](MINIMAL_AXIOMS_2026-06-29.md);
- the exact [Block-190 four-dimensional common-action boundary](ADMISSIBILITY_D4_DIRAC_KAHLER_COMMON_ACTION_WARD_TT_RECORD_MARK_BOUNDARY_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-24.md)
  at commit `c6737fe46df64315f895921c2362f50f00f0b036`; and
- the literal [Block-128 curved-carrier dependency](ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_CURVED_CARRIER_DEPENDENCY_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-17.md).

The carrier cap, action, mass, projectors, discovery momenta, two asymmetric
held-outs, transported frame, candidate states, reverse test, and write were
fixed before the target calculations.  No fitted similarity, third state,
response-selected projector, new momentum, or post-failure phase counts as a
Block-191 success.

The trace rule below is a candidate response functional.  The minimal axioms
do not select this instrument, identify its four effects with a site's local
possibilities, derive its weights, turn its response into a realized matter
source, or identify its pointer as a Record.

## 3. Block-128 Port: Correct Exterior Injection, Failed Plain Action

Keeping Block-190 directions zero and three as space and time gives an exact
four-form injection `J`:

\[
 J^\dagger J=I_4,
 \qquad J^\dagger c_0J=E_X,
 \qquad J^\dagger c_3J=E_T.
\]

The restricted incidence has rank two and squares to zero.  Across the eight
declared charts, the binary map `B` is a rank-32 isometry, but the literal
chart relation is

\[
 B^\dagger d_{128}B=i(I_8\otimes d_2).
\]

Thus the frozen plain action port fails at a Wick/degree phase.  Its flat
residual has eight nonzero entries, rank four, and determinant four; both
actions separately are full rank with determinant `2809/2401`.  On the curved
cover, both actions have rank 32 and their residual has 160 nonzero entries
and rank 32.

The degree phase

\[
 D_{\rm W}=\operatorname{diag}(1,-i,-i,-1)=(-i)^{\deg}
\]

repairs the flat action exactly.  It was outside the frozen plain port, and no
curved Hodge, reflection, vertex, or recoil intertwiner with this phase is
proved here.  It remains a live carrier convention, not a wall on all
Block-128 ports.

## 4. Reduced Four-Slice History Positivity

The one allowed native fallback uses a four-slice AP shift `U`, centered
temporal differential `D_t=(U-U^T)/2`, and edge reflection `R`:

\[
 U^4=-I,
 \qquad D_t^2=-\frac12I,
 \qquad RD_tR^T=-D_t.
\]

In the two-component Clifford reduction,

\[
 q=I_4\otimes(mI+i p\sigma_x)+D_t\otimes\sigma_z,
 \qquad r=p^2,
\]

so

\[
 q^\dagger q=(m^2+r+1/2)I_8,
 \qquad Rq^\dagger R^T=\overline q.
\]

The doubled reflection kernel is Hermitian.  Its raw history cut is full rank,
trace zero, and

\[
 H_{\rm raw}^2={I_8\over(2m^2+2r+1)^2},
\]

which gives exact inertia `(4,4,0)`.  The raw cut is therefore indefinite.

For the exact right Schur graph, the reflection-even port instead gives

\[
 G_+=g(m,r)I_4,
\]

where

\[
 g(m,r)=
 {8m\left(8m^4+16m^2r+6m^2+8r^2-2r+1\right)
  \over
  (2m^2+2r+1)(4m^2+4r+1)^2}>0
\]

for every `m>0`, `r>=0`; the odd port is `-gI_4`.  This is an exact positive
result for the reduced AP family.

The runner also checks the multiplicity-eight normalized algebraic lift
`G_+ tensor I_8`, whose state is `I_32/32` and whose two-time partial trace is
`I_16/16`.  It does **not** construct the full 16-form action intertwiner that
would justify identifying that lift with the Block-190 carrier at arbitrary
momentum.  The lift is therefore a reduced-history state candidate, not a
completed common-action history.

Reflection-even parity is the displayed positive candidate; the campaign does
not derive why a physical history would select that sector rather than the
negative reflection-odd one.

## 5. Grade-Three PVM And Conserved TT Response Candidate

For exterior Clifford generators

\[
 \gamma_{2\mu}=c_\mu+a_\mu,
 \qquad
 \gamma_{2\mu+1}=i(c_\mu-a_\mu),
\]

the frozen operators

\[
 O_1=i\gamma_0\gamma_2\gamma_3,
 \qquad
 O_2=i\gamma_1\gamma_2\gamma_5
\]

are commuting Hermitian involutions.  Their joint effects

\[
 E_{st}={(I+sO_1)(I+tO_2)\over4}
\]

are four orthogonal rank-four projectors summing to the identity.  For the
Block-190 polar state `rho=I_16/16`, the candidate weights are

\[
 w_{st}=\operatorname{Tr}(\rho E_{st})={1\over4}.
\]

This is a tested `Tr(rho E)` candidate law, not a derivation of Admissibility's
probability distribution or the Born rule.

Let `S_Aa(q)` be the frozen two-column TT section in tensor-coordinate order
`(xx,yy,zz,xy,xz,yz)`, and let

\[
 V_a^{TT}=\sum_A S_{Aa}V_A.
\]

The connected response is

\[
 C_{st,a}=\operatorname{Tr}\!\left[
   \left({E_{st}\over4}-{I\over16}\right)V_a^{TT}
 \right]
 =sK_{1a}+tK_{2a},
\]

with `K_ja=Tr(O_j V_a^TT)/16`.  The exact determinants of this `2x2` matrix
`K` on D1, D2, D3, H1, and H2 are

\[
 {\sqrt2 i\over32},\quad
 {\sqrt2 i\over64},\quad
 {-3i\over128},\quad
 {i(13-7\sqrt3)\over2048},\quad
 {i(2\sqrt6+5\sqrt2)\over4096}.
\]

All are nonzero.  The response candidate therefore has TT rank two at every
frozen point.  Its mass--Hodge contribution is zero, so it is entirely
derivative/recoil sensitive.  The complete outcome-conditioned vertex plus
both reciprocal recoil terms obeys the exact Ward identity.  Both held-outs
have all three terms separately nonzero in every spatial direction.  The
transported proper-cubic frame has zero covariance residual and retains rank
two.

The displayed determinants use the frozen TT-nullspace bases selected by the
runner.  Their particular values are basis dependent; nonvanishing, and hence
rank two, is the basis-invariant content used here.

These facts repair Block 190's specific derivative-blind trace-context
problem.  They do not make the trace response a realized matter source.

## 6. Decisive Same-Action Temporal Residual

The AP temporal spectrum is

\[
 k_t\in\{\pi/4,3\pi/4,5\pi/4,7\pi/4\},
 \qquad \sin^2k_t={1\over2}.
\]

The three discovery points use `k_t=pi/4`, so their Block-190 polar scalar
matches the AP scalar.  H1 and H2 use `k_t=pi/6`.  The exact comparison is:

| point | Block-190 `Q^dagger Q` scalar | AP `q^dagger q` scalar | Block-190 minus AP |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| H1 | `261/196` | `155/98` | `-1/4` |
| H2 | `359/196` | `102/49` | `-1/4` |

The same residual occurs at both outgoing momenta because the held-out
transfers have zero temporal component.

Write the lifted AP temporal-mode fiber at fixed spatial momentum as

\[
 A_{\rm AP}(k;s)=mI_{16}
 +i\!\left(\sum_{i=0}^{2}\sin k_i\,G_i+sG_3\right),
 \qquad s^2={1\over2}.
\]

Its left and right polar scalars agree:

\[
 A_{\rm AP}^\dagger A_{\rm AP}
 =A_{\rm AP}A_{\rm AP}^\dagger
 =(m^2+r+1/2)I_{16}.
\]

The Block-190 source action is likewise normal, with
`Q^dagger Q=Q Q^dagger=(m^2+r+sin^2(k_t))I_16`.  Suppose any linear map `J_h`
intertwined the held-out source action with the AP mode fiber,
`A_AP J_h=J_h Q`.  Taking Frobenius norms and using cyclicity gives

\[
 \lVert A_{\rm AP}J_h\rVert_F^2
 =(m^2+r+1/2)\lVert J_h\rVert_F^2,
 \qquad
 \lVert J_hQ\rVert_F^2
 =(m^2+r+1/4)\lVert J_h\rVert_F^2.
\]

The equality of the intertwined products and the exact `1/4` scalar mismatch
force `J_h=0`.  This mode invariant does not claim that a full history-action
intertwiner was otherwise constructed.  It is a no-port theorem for the
frozen `L=4` AP carrier and held-out modes, not for twisted, continuous-time,
per-stratum, or other temporal carriers.

Simply enlarging one standard AP circle cannot contain both exact sectors.
An AP mode has `(2n+1)pi/L`; including `pi/4` requires `L/4` odd, while
including `pi/6` requires `L/6` odd.  The first condition gives 2-adic
valuation `v2(L)=2` and the second gives `v2(L)=1`, a contradiction.  A repair
must change the temporal construction rather than scan a longer standard AP
volume.

The history reflection is also not yet a source-transition reflection.  Its
dual uses spatial momentum `-k_sp`, while the reverse response begins at
`k_sp+q_sp`.  No source insertion or outgoing-action map is carried into the
history Gram.  The object graph therefore stops at

\[
  J_{TT}(k,q)\ \not\longrightarrow\ G_{\rm history}.
\]

## 7. Two Downstream Reverse Conventions

For the original response, ordinary same-label reverse reality fails exactly:

\[
 C_{st}(k+q,-q)=-\overline{C_{st}(k,q)}.
\]

Exterior-form parity `P=(-1)^degree` obeys

\[
 Q^\dagger=PQP,
 \qquad V_A(k,q)^\dagger=PV_A(k+q,-q)P,
 \qquad PE_{st}P=E_{-s,-t}.
\]

It therefore gives the exact graded-outcome relation

\[
 C_{-s,-t}(k+q,-q)=\overline{C_{st}(k,q)}.
\]

There is a distinct ordinary-adjoint route.  Since the connected mass--Hodge
response vanishes, put `D=V-mH` and `X=-iD`.  Then the same-label response of
`X` obeys the positive conjugate relation.  Its Ward identity remains exact
only with the coherent rephasing

\[
 C_X-iC_R+iC_L=0.
\]

The `P` route changes the event label; the `X` route changes the source
convention and recoil phases.  Neither was frozen as the physical law, and
neither repairs the earlier temporal carrier mismatch.  A successor must
preregister them as a tournament after a common carrier exists.

## 8. Write Isometry Without A Record Claim

The frozen map

\[
 W=\begin{pmatrix}E_{--}\\E_{-+}\\E_{+-}\\E_{++}\end{pmatrix}
\]

obeys `W^dagger W=I_16`.  Acting on `I_16/16` gives a positive rank-16,
trace-one state with four orthogonal pointer sectors of candidate weight
`1/4`.  The runner also checks

\[
 (I_2\otimes W){I_{32}\over32}(I_2\otimes W)^\dagger
\]

as a positive rank-32 congruence.

That input is the unconditioned maximally mixed algebraic state, not a
source-conditioned reflected Block-190 history.  Pointer invariance is tested
only against identity continuation.  No formation dynamics, amplification,
local-possibility identification, or Record bridge is supplied.  The axiom
that records are permanent cannot identify this constructed pointer as a
Record by itself.

## 9. No-Go Discipline Gate

This gate returns **FAIL for any broad no-go** and demotes the result to
`partial-attempt-with-honest-residual`.  Only the frozen `L=4` AP held-out
intertwiner failure is closed.

### N1 -- normalized alternative-route enumeration

| family | object / mechanism / terminal obligation | marker | outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| Block-128 exterior port | literal curved chart / Wick-phase invariant / common action intertwiner | ATTEMPTED | plain port fails; flat `(-i)^degree` escape remains |
| native `L=4` AP port | AP temporal spectrum / polar-scalar invariant / held-out action intertwiner | ATTEMPTED | H1 and H2 force the intertwiner to zero |
| reduced doubled-Schur history | two-component Clifford block / reflection-even Schur positivity / full common-carrier history | ATTEMPTED | reduced positivity succeeds; full 16-form intertwiner is not executed |
| grade-three response | fixed PVM trace response / conditioned Ward and TT determinant / physical source adjoint | ATTEMPTED | algebraic response succeeds; ordinary reality and physical typing remain open |
| graded event transport | form parity / forced outcome relabel / reverse-real event law | ATTEMPTED | exact downstream relation; temporal carrier unchanged |
| Hermitianized response | `X=-i(V-mH)` / ordinary adjoint plus phased recoil / reverse-real source law | ATTEMPTED | exact downstream relation; temporal carrier unchanged |
| adjacent write | joint-projector isometry / positive congruence / source-conditioned permanent Record | ATTEMPTED | unconditioned write succeeds; composed history and Record identification absent |

Twisted time, continuous time, a per-stratum carrier family, and a new common
finite temporal complex are live untested families.  They cannot honestly be
marked `ATTEMPTED` or `RULED OUT BY PRIOR`.  Therefore N1 forbids a general
carrier or TOE no-go.

### N2 -- collapsed wall-dependence audit

Use the sequential wall set:

- `W1`: full-fiber common temporal carrier and incoming/outgoing history
  intertwiner;
- `W2`: physical source adjoint/event identification on a `W1` survivor;
- `W3`: source-conditioned reflected write and Record identification on a
  `W1+W2` survivor.

| pair | closing first closes second? | closing second closes first? | disposition |
|---|---|---|---|
| W1, W2 | no | no | distinct, but W1 is tested first |
| W1, W3 | no | yes, because a genuine W3 composition presupposes W1 | W3 is downstream, not independent |
| W2, W3 | no | yes, because a genuine W3 composition presupposes a typed source | W3 is downstream, not independent |

The Block-128 phase and `L=4` AP spectrum are alternative mechanisms inside
`W1`, not two inflated independent TOE walls.  Reverse convention and Record
dynamics cannot be advertised as co-equal first blockers while `W1` is empty.

### N3 -- hidden-condition scan

The phrases `canonical`, `native`, and `action-derived` were re-audited.  The
Block-128 map is canonical only relative to the literal landed chart; the AP
history is native only to its reduced four-slice construction; and its
normalized `I/16` state is not derived from the held-out Block-190 action.
The multiplicity-eight lift lacks a full-fiber intertwiner.  `Tr(rho E)` is a
candidate weight, not an axiom-supplied probability law.  The PVM is selected,
not dynamically chosen.  The response is a trace response candidate, not a
realized bilinear source.  The write is an unconditioned isometry, not a
Record.  Linearized gravity, five momentum points, one frame, positive mass,
and identity continuation are explicit finite-scope conditions.

### N4 -- exact residual matching

| cited witness | witness residual | present residual | match? |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Block 128](ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_CURVED_CARRIER_DEPENDENCY_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-17.md), lines 55--61 | missing common differential/global curved action in the displayed package | specific Wick/degree residual of the present port | no; used only as literal input data, not witness support |
| [Block 190](ADMISSIBILITY_D4_DIRAC_KAHLER_COMMON_ACTION_WARD_TT_RECORD_MARK_BOUNDARY_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-24.md), lines 394--405 | degree-preserving marks are derivative/recoil blind | grade-three response derivative visibility | yes; this local residual is positively repaired |
| [Block 190](ADMISSIBILITY_D4_DIRAC_KAHLER_COMMON_ACTION_WARD_TT_RECORD_MARK_BOUNDARY_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-24.md), lines 434--444 | general missing carrier/source/context/write conjunction | specific held-out AP temporal mismatch | no; present theorem sharpens one possible upstream failure but cannot witness the whole residual |
| PR #7351 curved OS control | different Block-107 carrier and window | present `L=4` AP/Block-190 polar mismatch | no; dropped as proof support |

Raw-cut indefiniteness and doubled-Schur positivity concern the same reduced AP
action, but neither matches the cross-carrier temporal residual.  They are not
cited as evidence for it.

### N5 -- resolution and rhetoric audit

per_element: checked Clifford involutions, joint projectors, polar state, and outcome weights.

per_site: checked the plain Block-128 carrier map and the local adjacent write isometry.

per_mode: checked the reduced analytic AP history family and five separate source momenta plus one transported frame.

per_block: checked separate carrier, source, history, and write blocks plus the failed same-action temporal port with ordinary, graded, and Hermitianized reverse tests.

lattice_wide: checked and not executed — no arbitrary lattice, nonlinear gravity, Born derivation, selected permanent Record law, refinement, or retained TOE theory is claimed.

The negative statement is only per-mode and per-block for the frozen `L=4`
AP/held-out pairing.  No lattice-wide carrier, source, history, or Record
negative is stated.

### N6 -- partial-closure and axiom scan

Form parity/outcome transport and the Hermitianized response are convention
routes, not new axioms.  The flat Block-128 degree phase is likewise a live
convention whose curved lift remains a physics obligation.  The minimal
Record axiom supplies permanence only after a constructed object is identified
as a record; it does not select this write or supply persistence dynamics.
The temporal carrier/intertwiner is downstream physical structure.  Current
evidence therefore supports neither an axiom amendment nor an assertion that
an axiom amendment is required.

### N7 -- hostile steelman

A hostile reviewer should reject any broader obstruction: the spectral proof
only excludes the frozen standard `L=4` AP carrier at the two held-out time
momenta.  A twisted or continuous-time history, a per-stratum carrier family,
or a new finite temporal complex could contain both sectors and furnish the
missing incoming/outgoing insertion.  Once such a carrier exists, the already
exact `P` and `X` adjoint conventions form a concrete tournament rather than
a mystery.  This actionable route defeats a general no-go and forces the
partial-attempt classification.

### N8 -- cross-cycle echo

Block 190's derivative-blind readout residual was repaired here by changing
the instrument grade.  The flat Block-128 action mismatch is repaired exactly
by a degree phase, though its curved lift remains open.  The raw AP cut is
indefinite while the doubled-Schur port is positive.  Each is a direct example of a
prior-looking wall retiring under a changed but controlled mechanism.  The
same discipline requires trying new temporal carriers before any broad
negative claim.

The next campaign should freeze an exact target contract for a full 16-form
temporal carrier.  It must map both incoming and outgoing Block-190 actions at
every frozen point into one reflected history object, insert the conditioned
TT response into that Gram, and carry the actual Gram through the write.
Only a survivor should enter a preregistered `P`-versus-`X` adjoint tournament
and nonidentity Record test.  More momentum scanning, new projectors, or an
axiom edit would avoid the first empty arrow rather than close it.
