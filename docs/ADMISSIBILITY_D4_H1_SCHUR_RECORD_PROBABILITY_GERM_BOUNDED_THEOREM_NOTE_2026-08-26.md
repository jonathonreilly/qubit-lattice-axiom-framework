claim_scope: "On the fixed Block-193 H1 L24 two-sector action, ordinary-transpose right-Schur cut, literal forward/actual-reverse second-TT source family, and fixed Block-194 C32 PVM/M2 dilation, strict zero-source Schur positivity and analytic finite-dimensional inversion combine with the exact nonzero signed H1 derivative to prove a nonzero interval of positive normalized nonuniform eight-outcome laws. The four coarse port derivatives and both global pointer-sign marginal derivatives vanish, while the port-conditioned binary M2 probabilities and one port-pointer correlation have exact nonzero derivative. The fixed pointer unitary pulls the eight effects back exactly. This is a conditional same-action right-Schur probability germ, not a periodic CAR state, not a Lambda(C32) state, not a proof that H1 is the axiom's nearest-neighbor eta, and not autonomous Record formation, permanent-history dynamics, a two-TT theorem, an axiom amendment, obligation retirement, retained status, or TOE percentage movement."
claim_type_reason: "The positive-germ implication is an exact finite-dimensional theorem: the two action/Schur inverse denominators are nonzero at zero source, the parent exact LDL certificate makes the zero-source Gram strictly positive, the fixed eight effects form a complete PVM, and an exact algebraic derivative is nonzero. Analyticity and openness therefore supply a finite nonzero interval even though no explicit maximal endpoint is claimed. Standing remains bounded because the physical nearest-neighbor context, formation/actualization, history, two-TT completeness, and retained audit are open."

## 1. Result Up Front

Block 205 finds the first positive, nonconstant, same-action one-shot law on
the fixed Block-194 `C32` Record-effect carrier.  The law is a **local analytic
germ around zero source**, not merely a table of tangent values.

The object is the normalized boundary marginal of the literal Block-193
two-sector right-Schur family.  At zero source its two `C16` diagonal blocks
are action-derived scalar multiples of `I16`; the two scalar weights need not
be equal.  Nevertheless every fixed Block-194 atom has value `1/8`.

At H1, the first TT direction is exactly blind.  The second TT direction has
one exact positive response coefficient `ell`.  In the Block-194 ordering

```text
(st_0,+),(st_0,-),(st_1,+),(st_1,-),
(st_2,+),(st_2,-),(st_3,+),(st_3,-),
```

the eight probability derivatives are

```text
(ell/8) * (+,-,+,-,-,+,-,+).
```

The two signs at every fixed coarse port cancel.  Both global pointer-sign
marginals also cancel.  But the binary probability **conditioned on the
coarse port** varies, and the port-pointer correlation has derivative `ell`.

This is real positive mathematical progress: action, positive state, PVM,
coarse addition, and pointer pullback now coexist on one typed carrier for a
finite nonzero source interval.  It is not yet TOE progress.  H1 is a Fourier
source fixture, not a derived nearest-neighbor condition, and one pointer
unitary is not a formation or permanent-history law.

## 2. Frozen Construction

The registration at `d067fbb5d2` froze:

- mass `m=2/7`;
- the periodic `L=24` coordinate carrier and `0..11 | 12..23` cut;
- H1 and TT column index `1`;
- the literal forward and actual-reverse source blocks;
- ordinary transpose in the right-Schur half-form;
- the fixed Block-194 degree-two detector orientation;
- all eight Block-194 rank-four effects; and
- the fixed nonidentity `M2` pointer dilation.

For source amplitude `e`, let

\[
 A(e)=
 \begin{pmatrix}A_{\rm in}&eB\\eC&A_{\rm out}\end{pmatrix}. \tag{1}
\]

With `E_N` and `E_P` the fixed first- and second-half embeddings, define

\[
 R(e)=E_N-E_P(E_P^TA(e)E_P)^{-1}E_P^TA(e)E_N, \tag{2}
\]

\[
 H(e)=R(e)^T A(e)^{-1}R(e),
 \qquad G(e)=H(e)+H(e)^\dagger. \tag{3}
\]

The `C32` boundary state is

\[
 \rho_R(e)={\operatorname{Tr}_{\rm time}G(e)\over
                  \operatorname{Tr}G(e)}, \tag{4}
\]

and the eight event values are

\[
 p_i(e)=\operatorname{Tr}(\rho_R(e)F_i). \tag{5}
\]

Equation (4), not a monodromy, is the Block-205 state.  It is an ordinary-
transpose right-Schur boundary marginal.  It is **not a periodic CAR state**
and is not a state on `Lambda(C32)`.

## 3. Exact Zero-Source State

The runner reconstructs both H1 endpoint sectors from the Block-192 action.
Their positive-half temporal traces are

\[
 \operatorname{Tr}_{\rm time}G_{\rm in}(0)=aI_{16},
 \qquad
 \operatorname{Tr}_{\rm time}G_{\rm out}(0)=bI_{16}, \tag{6}
\]

with `a>0` and `b>0` exact.  Therefore

\[
 \rho_R(0)=
 \operatorname{diag}\!\left(
 {wI_{16}\over16},{(1-w)I_{16}\over16}
 \right),
 \qquad
 w={16a\over16a+16b}. \tag{7}
\]

This is action-derived.  No `I32/32` state and no equal-sector population is
imported.

The inherited exact LDL theorem gives strict positivity of the full
zero-source right-Schur Gram at every frozen H1 endpoint radius.  The eight
effects are nonzero orthogonal projectors of rank four and sum to `I32`.
Their off-diagonal sector signs do not contribute to (7), while every
diagonal rank-four block sees the same scalar marginal.  Hence

\[
 p_i(0)={1\over8},\qquad i=1,\ldots,8. \tag{8}
\]

Uniformity at `e=0` is a consequence of the action-derived block-scalar state,
not the input law.

## 4. Exact Nonzero H1 Derivative

The literal source pair is off-diagonal in the two sectors.  Its actual
reverse is not replaced by the Hermitian adjoint control.  Let `Z_H` denote
the exact zero-source normalization.  Contracting the exact Schur tangent
against the four detector connectors gives a single positive coefficient

\[
 \ell=
 {9091679599806191497029877413353318714827442776228259391876320236611592529853787
  \,(7-3\sqrt3)
 \over
  29294716671255543678574385056367635537142669186818226512976035477340009933739972300}
 >0. \tag{9}
\]

The first TT column has zero contraction with all four connectors.  For the
second TT column,

\[
 {d p_i\over de}(0)
 ={\ell\over8}(+,-,+,-,-,+,-,+)_i. \tag{10}
\]

Thus

\[
 {d\over de}\bigl(p_{st,+}+p_{st,-}\bigr)_{e=0}=0
 \quad\hbox{for every }st. \tag{11}
\]

The result is rank one, not rank two.  It supports one source direction and
does not repair the other TT polarization.

## 5. Why This Is A Finite Positive Law, Not A Tangent State

Every entry of (1) is affine in `e`.  At `e=0`, both `A(0)` and the `P` block
in (2) are invertible because their exact inverses are reconstructed by the
parent runner.  Their inverse entries are therefore rational analytic
functions on some nonzero real interval around zero.  Equations (2)--(5) are
analytic on a possibly smaller interval.

Strict positivity of a finite Hermitian matrix is open.  Since `G(0)` is
strictly positive, there exists `epsilon_0>0` such that

\[
 G(e)\succ0,
 \qquad \operatorname{Tr}G(e)>0
 \quad (|e|<\epsilon_0). \tag{12}
\]

The complete PVM then gives

\[
 p_i(e)>0,
 \qquad \sum_i p_i(e)=1
 \quad (|e|<\epsilon_0) \tag{13}
\]

after shrinking the interval if necessary.  Equation (10) is nonzero, so the
analytic family cannot remain uniform on that interval.  In particular,
there are finite nonzero values of `e`, arbitrarily close to zero, for which
the eight-vector is positive, normalized, and nonuniform.

The tangent is used only to prove that the exact finite family is
nonconstant.  It is never normalized or called a density matrix.

An exploratory pre-registration floating calculation reported positivity at
`e=1/2` and loss of positivity at `e=1`.  It was disclosed in the preflight
packet and is not used in (12)--(13).  This note claims existence of a
nonzero interval, not a certified maximal endpoint.

## 6. Coarse Ports, Binary `M2`, And Correlation

For a fixed coarse port `st`, define

\[
 p_{st}=p_{st,+}+p_{st,-},
 \qquad
 q_{\sigma|st}={p_{st,\sigma}\over p_{st}}. \tag{14}
\]

At zero source, `p_st=1/4` and `q_{sigma|st}=1/2`.  Equations (10)--(11) give

\[
 {d q_{\sigma|st}\over de}(0)
 ={\ell\over2}(+,-,+,-,-,+,-,+)_{st,\sigma}. \tag{15}
\]

Thus the local binary pointer law changes when the external port context is
held fixed.  Summing over all four ports leaves both global pointer-sign
marginals stationary at first order.  The change is a correlation, not a
global pointer bias.

With the port character `c=(+,+,-,-)` and pointer sign `sigma`, the derivative
of the joint correlation is

\[
 {d\over de}\,\mathbb E[c(st)\sigma]_{e=0}=\ell\ne0. \tag{16}
\]

The Block-194 writer is a nonidentity unitary on `C32 tensor C2`.  Pulling
back its four coarse-port readouts and two pointer projectors through the
fixed zero-pointer input reproduces the eight `F_i` exactly.  Consequently the
pointer probabilities and postselected positive states agree with (5) and
(14); no second law is inserted at the writer.

The four port labels are not themselves one `M2`.  The pointer signs form the
binary `M2` alternatives **conditional on a supplied port context**.

## 7. Probability And Physical-Context Boundary

For every `e` in the positive interval, (4) defines a positive normalized
linear functional on `M32`.  Its restriction to the commutative algebra
generated by the eight orthogonal projectors is an ordinary finite
probability measure.  Coarse probabilities add because the coarse projector
is the sum of its orthogonal atoms.

That mathematical statement does not finish the physical identification.
The current minimal axioms say that the local probability distribution varies
with nearest-neighbor conditions, but they do not select this detector, this
right-Schur state, or the effect-trace bridge.  The Block-194 apparatus gives
a concrete binary `M2` pointer context; H1 remains a Fourier/action source
fixture.  The **nearest-neighbor eta remains open**.

Record locking also remains conditional.  The writer shows how a supplied
event is copied to a pointer.  It does not select a formation site or rate,
actualize one branch, amplify readability, or construct a time-extended
permanent Record.  The Record axiom's permanence sentence cannot be used to
declare every mathematical pointer a Record before that identification.

## 8. Covariance Scope

The fixed detector family and its four-event context transform exactly under
all 24 proper cubic rotations.  The fixed reflection exchanges the declared
event/pointer labels, and trace evaluation is invariant under simultaneous
unitary transport of state and effect:

\[
 \operatorname{Tr}(U\rho U^\dagger\,UFU^\dagger)
 =\operatorname{Tr}(\rho F). \tag{17}
\]

This establishes covariance of the supplied detector/context construction.
It does not claim that every nearest-neighbor configuration has been mapped
to an H1 source or that a finite H2 source family has already been certified.

## 9. H2 And Explicit-Interval Status

The H1 exact germ is the primary preregistered theorem.  The H2 finite-source
held-out and a certified explicit lower bound for `epsilon_0` remain separate
generality targets unless a later result section records them.  Their absence
does not weaken the local existence proof, but it blocks a general source or
fixture theorem.

## 10. Axiom Decision

No minimal-axiom edit is justified.  Block 204 found multiple mathematical
positive extensions, but not two complete physical models with the same
action, source, event context, formation law, and readable Record semantics.
Block 205 constructs one conditional physical candidate rather than proving
irreducible physical underdetermination.

A future amendment decision would require two complete same-input laws that
survive every derived discriminator and still disagree.  Until then, the
source-to-context and formation choices are downstream science obligations,
not evidence that the axioms are inconsistent or incomplete.

## 11. No-Go Discipline Gate

This block ships a positive bounded theorem and several named walls.  The
N1--N8 audit is therefore load-bearing against accidental broad negatives.

### N1 -- normalized alternative-route enumeration

| route | mechanism / terminal obligation | status | exact disposition |
|---|---|---|---|
| H1 right-Schur state | literal two-sector source / positive normalized nonconstant PVM law | `POSITIVE` | exact analytic germ passes |
| explicit interval endpoint | algebraic determinant/inertia boundary / certified finite amplitude range | `UNTESTED` | pre-registration floats are not evidence |
| H2/general source | same detector and source convention / fixture generality | `UNTESTED` | remains live |
| nearest-neighbor context | inverse Fourier/local apparatus map / `eta -> rho_eta,F_i` | `UNTESTED` | live physical bridge |
| periodic CAR descent | typed one-body or event-space action / positive Record values | `UNTESTED HERE` | Block 204 remains distinct |
| AP/open/infinite-time state | changed spin/boundary reconstruction / positive history state | `UNTESTED HERE` | live |
| autonomous Record formation | local environment/amplifier / actualization and permanence | `UNTESTED` | live downstream |
| complete extensional law | state, menu, hazard, clock, source, decoder, collisions / owner-ready closure | `UNTESTED` | highest later decision surface |

No negative statement may absorb these routes.

### N2 -- wall-independence audit

The collapsed walls are:

- `W_state`: a positive nonconstant one-shot state/effect law;
- `W_context`: physical identification of source, port, and local `M2`
  nearest-neighbor context;
- `W_formation`: actualization, formation site/rate, and readable pointer;
- `W_history`: a selected inter-event law and permanent histories; and
- `W_generality`: H2/source/cubic/local-fixture extent.

Block 205 closes `W_state` only on the H1 analytic germ.  A positive state does
not select a formation event.  Formation does not identify the microscopic
state.  A one-shot instrument does not select its inter-event channel.
Covariance of the detector does not identify H1 with every local condition.
The walls are directionally independent.

### N3 -- hidden-condition scan

- `same-action` means the literal Block-193 finite-source right-Schur family,
  not the Block-203 periodic graded functional.
- `finite law` means an analytic state family on a proved nonzero interval;
  it does not mean the derivative matrix is positive.
- `M2 law` means the two pointer alternatives after conditioning on one
  supplied coarse port; the four ports are not compressed into a qubit.
- `Record` is not used as a synonym for pointer, effect, or branch.
- `eta` is not used as a synonym for a Fourier H1 source.
- The floating `e=1/2` scout is not an exact certificate.

### N4 -- citation-by-citation residual matching

| source | inherited result | use here | match |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Block 192 right-Schur note](ADMISSIBILITY_D4_FULL_TEMPORAL_CARRIER_SOURCE_HISTORY_WRITE_BOUNDARY_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-25.md) | exact zero-source positivity and scalar internal marginal | strict baseline for the analytic germ | exact |
| [Block 193 Record-law note](ADMISSIBILITY_D4_FIXED_L24_RECORD_LAW_DISCRIMINATOR_BOUNDARY_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-25.md) | literal two-sector source and Schur tangent | fixed finite family and derivative | exact |
| [Block 194 detector note](ADMISSIBILITY_D4_DETECTOR_CONDITIONED_M2_POINTER_DISCRIMINATOR_BOUNDARY_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-25.md) | selected PVM, rank-one H1 response, M2 writer | fixed event/pointer context | exact |
| [Block 204 Record-descent note](ADMISSIBILITY_D4_RECORD_OPERATOR_SYSTEM_DESCENT_OS_PROBABILITY_CONTROL_BOUNDARY_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-26.md) | strict lift failure, positive-map survival, carrier fences | excludes CAR/Schur conflation | exact scope only |
| [minimal axioms](MINIMAL_AXIOMS_2026-06-29.md) | local distribution and Record wording; downstream context/weight/formation rules | physical-boundary statement | premise typing only |

No parent negative is recycled to prove failure of an untested route.

### N5 -- execution resolution

per_element: checked the literal H1 source column, all eight fixed C32 effects, four coarse ports, two pointer signs, exact derivatives, and normalized positive-germ implications.

per_site: checked the fixed nonidentity M2 pointer pullback conditional on one supplied coarse port; no autonomous formation site, hazard, or permanence dynamics is supplied.

per_mode: checked the H1 second TT direction exactly and the blind first direction as a control; the H2 finite-family held-out remains separate unless explicitly reported.

per_block: checked the full two-sector Schur family, C32 boundary marginal, PVM, and pointer as distinct typed blocks; no periodic CAR or Lambda(C32) state is inferred.

lattice_wide: checked and not executed — the Fourier H1 source is not identified with every nearest-neighbor eta, and no full-Z3 history, gravity completion, retained theory, axiom edit, or TOE closure is claimed.

### N6 -- partial-closure and axiom scan

The reusable positive chain is now

```text
literal H1 action/source
  -> positive analytic right-Schur C32 state
  -> complete eight-effect probability law
  -> port-conditioned binary M2 probabilities
  -> exact nonidentity pointer pullback.
```

That chain should be preserved.  The next productive work is context/eta and
formation attachment, not another arbitrary POVM enumeration.  The current
axiom memo needs no change.

### N7 -- strongest hostile steelman

> The proof gives only an existence interval near zero.  It does not certify
> `e=1/2`, establish H2, show both TT polarizations, or construct a
> nearest-neighbor local source.  A full OS/GNS reconstruction, a different
> detector, AP/open time, or a complete extensional law could behave
> differently.  The pointer dilation realizes effects but does not actualize
> one outcome or generate a permanent Record.

This objection is correct and fixes the standing at bounded support.  It does
not refute the exact H1 germ.

### N8 -- cross-cycle echo

- Block 192 repaired the temporal-carrier and zero-source positivity wall.
- Blocks 193--194 supplied the literal source, fixed PVM, and pointer but
  stopped on a rank-two response demand.
- Block 195 and later history blocks showed that a one-shot instrument does
  not select an inter-event channel.
- Block 203's periodic graded functional failed positivity on a different
  carrier.
- Block 204 preserved the positive right-Schur route and exposed the need to
  type state, event, and full-Fock objects separately.

Block 205 does not rerun the strict-lift obstruction.  It composes the
surviving positive objects and lowers the response demand honestly to one
conditional source direction.

**N1--N8 disposition:** PASS for the exact bounded H1 positive-germ claim;
FAIL for any broad source, context, Record, history, periodic-state, axiom, or
TOE completion claim.

## 12. TOE And Obligation Accounting

| lane | before | after | reason |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Records | 95 / 92 / 50 | 95 / 92 / 50 | positive one-shot pointer candidate; no formation/permanent history |
| causal time | 76 / 72 / 41 | 76 / 72 / 41 | no selected inter-event law |
| matter | 95 / 96 / 75 | 95 / 96 / 75 | unchanged |
| gravity/source | 70 / 45 / 29 | 70 / 45 / 29 | H1 rank one, not a two-TT gravity theorem |
| Born/history | 84 / 63 / 34 | 84 / 63 / 34 | conditional positive law; context, formation, retention open |

Formal derivation-obligation retirement is zero because the current registry's
three canonical open entries are unrelated to this seam.  Campaign-local
`W_state` is positively closed on the H1 germ, but no audit verdict or retained
status follows.

obligation retirement: 0

TOE percentage movement: 0

## 13. Highest-Leverage Successor

The first successor is the physical `eta`/context attachment: identify a
local nearest-neighbor condition whose same action produces (4), retain the
coarse port as an apparatus context, and attach the pointer branch to a
current formation/permanence mechanism.  H2 and an explicit positivity bound
are cheap generality controls after this theorem.

The periodic `C32` route remains a capped secondary gate and must first repair
its type equation.  It should not displace the positive context/formation
vertical slice unless the latter fails on a named exact condition.
