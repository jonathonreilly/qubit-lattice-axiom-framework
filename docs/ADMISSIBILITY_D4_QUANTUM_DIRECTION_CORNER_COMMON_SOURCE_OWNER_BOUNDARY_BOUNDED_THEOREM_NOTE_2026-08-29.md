## 1. Result Up Front

There is now one explicit positive local law that treats H1 and H2 as two
states of the same source object rather than two lookup tables.

At a blank site, take the full `M2(C)` contents of its six nearest-neighbor
Records.  One fixed formula produces a probability distribution over fourteen
one-site qubit possibilities: six axis directions and eight body-corner
directions.  Every probability is strictly positive for every allowed
six-neighbor Bloch tuple, the probabilities sum exactly to one, and proper
cubic rotations merely permute them.  The trace-free second moment of this
distribution contains exactly five independent numbers, transforming as

```text
E direct-sum T2.
```

That is precisely the minimal common source module found in
[Block 08](ADMISSIBILITY_D4_COMMON_SPIN2_SOURCE_MODULE_SIX_BIT_CAPACITY_BOUNDARY_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-29.md).
With the preregistered normalization, the moment returns the exact H1 tensor,
the exact H2 tensor, all 24 rotations of each, and both native forward and
literal actual-reverse sources.  It also returns a symbolic five-parameter
trace-free family identically, so the result is not an H1/H2 interpolation.

The corners are not new diagonal lattice sites.  Each corner is the equal
mixture of the three nearest-neighbor contents selected by its signs.  This is
the precise positive realization of the earlier candidate statement
"directions compare qubits; cells weigh corners."

The registered verdict is nevertheless **`CAPACITY-ONLY`**.  Here that label
does not mean a dimension count: an extensional, positive, normalized local
distribution has actually been built.  It means the current stack still lacks
one load-bearing physical attachment.  The same neighboring `M2` contents have
not been proved to carry both this quadrupole and the action-phase/clock data
used by the native source, nor has the action been shown to prepare the tested
neighbor contents causally.  Candidate Block 208 explicitly leaves that
action-state solder and Record attachment open.

Thus the common spatial law survives strongly, while complete physical
ownership does not yet follow.

## 2. Frozen Local Distribution

Let

```text
D = {+e_x,-e_x,+e_y,-e_y,+e_z,-e_z}
```

and write each neighboring Record content as

\[
 \rho_n={I+v_n\cdot\sigma\over2},\qquad \|v_n\|\leq1.       \tag{1}
\]

Define

\[
 S(v)=\operatorname{STF}\!\left[
 {1\over4}\sum_{n\in D}(nv_n^T+v_nn^T)\right].              \tag{2}
\]

For `tau=1/24`, the six axis probabilities are

\[
 p_{\pm e_i}={1\over12}+{\tau\over2}S_{ii},                  \tag{3}
\]

and the eight corner probabilities are

\[
 p_c={1\over16}+{3\tau\over8}
 (S_{xy}c_xc_y+S_{yz}c_yc_z+S_{xz}c_xc_z),                  \tag{4}
\]

where `c in {+/-1}^3`.  The associated qubit possibilities have Bloch
directions `+/-e_i` and `c/sqrt(3)`.

For arbitrary six Bloch balls, exact coefficient bounds give

\[
 |S_{ii}|\leq{4\over3},\qquad |S_{ij}|\leq1.                 \tag{5}
\]

Consequently every axis probability is at least `1/18`, every corner
probability is at least `1/64`, and their exact sum is one.  No target fixture
is used in this proof.

Let

\[
 M(p)=\operatorname{STF}\!\left[
 \sum_{n\in D}p_nnn^T+\sum_c p_c{cc^T\over3}\right].        \tag{6}
\]

Direct symbolic cancellation gives

\[
 M(p)=\tau S(v).                                               \tag{7}
\]

Both the map from the 18 neighbor Bloch coordinates to `S` and the map from
the five `S` coordinates to the fourteen probabilities have rank five.

## 3. Direction/Corner Preparation Witness

For a trace-free spatial tensor `Q`, the preregistered positive-control
preparation is

\[
 v_n(Q)=-{3\over4}Qn.                                         \tag{8}
\]

It is used only to test reachability.  The runtime law (2)--(4) receives the
six `rho_n`; it never receives `Q`, H1/H2, a TT coefficient, momentum, or an
orbit label.

For a sign triple `c`, select the three neighbors `c_i e_i` and take their
equal mixture.  Its Bloch vector is

\[
 b_c={v_{c_xe_x}+v_{c_ye_y}+v_{c_ze_z}\over3}
     =-{Qc\over4}.                                             \tag{9}
\]

Equation (9) reproduces the candidate Block-207 corner witness without
placing a qubit at a diagonal site.  Since it is a convex mixture of three
actual neighbor contents, it is a physical `M2` state whenever those contents
are.

Equations (2), (7), and (8) give

\[
 S=-{3\over4}Q,\qquad M=-{Q\over32},\qquad Q_{\rm source}=-32M=Q. \tag{10}
\]

The factors in (10) were frozen in the preregistration before target
execution.

## 4. Exact H1 And H2 Tests

The spatial tensor uses the action's normalized symmetric basis: diagonal
slots have unit matrix entries and off-diagonal coefficient slots multiply
matrices with entries `1/sqrt(2)`.

For H1, the physical tensor is

\[
 Q_{H1}=\begin{pmatrix}
 0&0&-1\\
 0&0&1/\sqrt2\\
 -1&1/\sqrt2&0
 \end{pmatrix}.                                                 \tag{11}
\]

The maximum squared neighbor Bloch norm under (8) is `27/32`; the maximum
composite-corner norm is `(3+sqrt(2))/16`.

For H2,

\[
 Q_{H2}=\begin{pmatrix}
 (3+\sqrt3)/4&-\sqrt6/4&0\\
 -\sqrt6/4&-(1+\sqrt3)/4&1/\sqrt2\\
 0&1/\sqrt2&-1/2
 \end{pmatrix}.                                                 \tag{12}
\]

The maximum squared neighbor norm is
`(81+27 sqrt(3))/128`, strictly below one.  The maximum composite-corner norm
is `3 sqrt(2)/64 + sqrt(3)/16 + 3/16`, also strictly below one.

For both tensors:

- all six neighbor states and all eight composite mixtures are positive;
- all fourteen probabilities are positive and normalized;
- (10) returns every normalized tensor coefficient exactly;
- the target orbit has 24 elements and the same law works in every frame;
- no scalar `A1` trace is introduced.

## 5. Native Forward And Actual-Reverse Source

Let `F` and `F_reverse` be the frozen native maps from the ten normalized
symmetric coefficients to the full action source.  Their full ranks are ten.
On the common trace-free module, both ranks are five.

Substituting the source moment (10) gives the exact H1 and H2 forward sources
and the exact literal actual reverses.  The reverse uses the inherited
physical `(p,q)->(p+q,-q)` map, not an adjoint surrogate.  One common spatial
moment therefore supplies the complete coefficient input to both orientations.

This is an algebraic composition with the native action map.  It does not by
itself prove that the action's phase and temporal factors occupy the same six
physical Record contents.

## 6. Symbolic Open-Family Holdout

After freezing all coefficients, the runner evaluates

\[
 Q(a,b,d,e,f)=\begin{pmatrix}
 a&d&e\\ d&b&f\\ e&f&-a-b
 \end{pmatrix}.                                                 \tag{13}
\]

Symbolically, not at selected samples,

\[
 -32M(p(v(Q)))=Q                                                \tag{14}
\]

with Jacobian rank five.  On the full rational box

```text
|a|,|b|,|d|,|e|,|f| <= 1/4,
```

the maximum squared neighbor norm is `27/128` and the maximum composite-corner
norm is `9/128`.  A deterministic rational interior sample is an additional
falsifier, not the evidence for (14).

This open-family identity is why the positive result is not an H1/H2 lookup
or interpolation.

## 7. Law Statistic Versus Realized Record

Equations (3)--(4) are the **law-level distribution**.  A forming Record locks
one of its supported one-site possibilities.  The tensor (6) is a statistic
of that distribution, **not the realized one-Record outcome**.  Across
repeated comparable Records, frequencies can in principle infer the
probabilities and hence the moment; one individual outcome does not equal the
five-component tensor.

This separation matches the minimal Admissibility/Record wording.  It does
not supply formation site, rate, a realized draw mechanism, or an operational
tomography protocol.

## 8. Ownership Audit And Verdict

The runtime function has one argument: the six neighboring Bloch contents.
Its source contains no H1/H2, TT/source, fixture, orbit, momentum, M4, or
same-event post-state input.  Thus the extensional distribution itself is
fixture blind.

The stronger ownership gate still fails.  Candidate Block 207 at science
commit `04b1c5d132f7ad46d6818854f8b733391ebdb6d2` left the actual Record
comparison and clock input open.  Candidate Block 208
constructed a positive endpoint/two-time compiler but explicitly left the
action-state solder, cell-leg typing, and Record attachment open.  No current
bridge proves that its phase/clock inputs and the six quadrupole contents in
(1) are one typed physical input or a causally prepared local relay.

Therefore **the action-state solder remains open**, joint clock-`M2` typing is
not proved, and the preregistered verdict is `CAPACITY-ONLY`.

This is not evidence that such a solder is impossible.  It is the exact next
positive construction target.

## 9. Axiom Decision

No minimal-axiom edit is justified.  Qubit supplies the one-site `M2` domain,
and Admissibility permits one fixed nearest-neighbor distribution varying with
neighboring conditions.  Equations (2)--(4) are a concrete candidate for that
missing extensional law.  The absent action-state solder and causal preparation
are downstream realization bridges, not contradictions in the axioms.

An extra primitive bit or on-site M4 should not be added merely to bypass this
typing problem.  The next campaign should first test a single covariant
intertwiner or causal relay that co-encodes the Block-208 action phase/clock and
the present `E+T2` moment in the existing neighboring `M2` conditions.

## 10. No-Go Discipline

The complete N1--N8 packet is in
[`NO_GO_DISCIPLINE_CHECKLIST.md`](../.claude/science/physics-loops/toe-source-eta-ownership-block09-quantum-quadrupole-owner-20260829/NO_GO_DISCIPLINE_CHECKLIST.md).
Its status is `PASS` only for the scoped current-stack ownership boundary.
The positive universal kernel and open-family identity defeat any broader
local-source, quantum-condition, action-family, axiom, or TOE no-go.

## 11. TOE And Obligation Accounting

| lane | before | after | reason |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Records | 95 / 92 / 50 | 95 / 92 / 50 | a full positive local distribution is explicit; formation/readout attachment remains open |
| causal time | 76 / 72 / 41 | 76 / 72 / 41 | joint clock/action typing is now the first wall, not closed |
| matter | 95 / 96 / 75 | 95 / 96 / 75 | common source state family survives; no named matter obligation retires |
| gravity/source | 70 / 45 / 29 | 70 / 45 / 29 | H1/H2 share one exact local moment; physical source/action solder and gravity coupling remain open |
| Born/history | 84 / 63 / 34 | 84 / 63 / 34 | distribution is explicit, but realized history/rate/clock are unexecuted |

obligation retirement: 0

TOE percentage movement: 0

The result is meaningful route progress but not scored TOE closure.

## 12. Highest-Leverage Successor

Construct one action-native, proper-cubic-covariant joint encoder/intertwiner
whose physical inputs are causal-past nearest-neighbor Records and whose same
`M2` contents provide:

1. the Block-208 relative action phase and temporal comparison;
2. the present five-component quadrupole moment;
3. the exact H1/H2 native forward and literal reverse source; and
4. a located output possibility distribution without a target tensor, extra
   on-site factor, same-event feedback, or downstream M4 state.

The decisive outcomes should be one typed joint law, a precise M2 coexistence
failure with distributed-relay alternatives still open, or two distinct
same-input laws that meet the axiom-update evidence threshold.  Another
separate H1/H2 fit would add no value.

## Verification

The primary runner checks universal positivity and normalization, exact moment
inversion, all 24 cubic frames, H1/H2 state and corner positivity, both native
orientations, the symbolic held-out family, and the ownership dependency graph.
The independent checker rebuilds those objects without importing the primary
runner.  Cached scorecards and mutation counts are pinned in the packet state.

The independent checker is author-side cross-validation, not an audit verdict.
No `review-loop`, audit verdict, axiom edit, or retained-status mutation is
part of this campaign.
