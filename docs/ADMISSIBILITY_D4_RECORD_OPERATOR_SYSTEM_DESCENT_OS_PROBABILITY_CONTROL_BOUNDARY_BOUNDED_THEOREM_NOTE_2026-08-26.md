## 1. Result Up Front

The action-to-Record route is not absent.  It is positively underdetermined.

The strict projective lifts tested here do fail: ordinary exterior lifts share
the vacuum and miss mixed-port occupations, at-least-one-port projectors
overlap, and exact `N=1` compression changes the periodic functional.  That is
only the projective part of the result.

Three exact positive, unital, faithful, number-preserving, port-covariant POVM
extensions exist on the entire `Lambda(C32)` carrier.  They agree with the
fixed PVM on `N=1` and differ on multi-port states.  Thus positivity does not
fail.  Coarse-event additivity does not select a map.  A stronger
multiplicity-splitting rule selects number-share inside a declared ratio
ansatz, but the present action and Record context do not supply that physical
identification.

More importantly, the fixed PVM itself has an exact internal structure missed
by a dimension-only argument:

\[
 \mathbb C^{32}\cong
 \mathbb C^8_{\rm syndrome}\otimes\mathbb C^4_{\rm logical},
 \qquad F_i=|i\rangle\!\langle i|\otimes I_4. \tag{1}
\]

The logical factor is exactly the same dimension as Block 203's two-mode CAR
space.  The PVM is therefore a Naimark host for every eight-outcome POVM on a
`C4` input.  What is missing is no longer an abstract positive map.  It is the
physical, same-action Kraus/intertwiner tuple that identifies Block 203's
`C4` with the logical fibers and populates the eight syndrome alternatives.

The separate positive right-Schur control is also sharper than the earlier
baseline.  For block-diagonal sector mixtures it gives exactly `1/8` for all
eight effects for any classical sector population.  It is not independent of
coherence: an exact positive coherent extension gives
`(1+sigma epsilon)/8`.

No periodic Record value is manufactured, no named obligation is retired, no
TOE percentage moves, and no axiom edit is supported.  The real progress is a
much smaller next target: construct the full `C32` action state/covariance and
solve its exact intertwiner with the logical `C4`, or prove that the required
object is not supplied by the current action.

## 2. Authority And Frozen Target

The runners bind:

- `origin/main` at `76df4becc8233080bc5a10a4baf55f83e80f8f2d`;
- the unchanged [minimal-axiom memo](MINIMAL_AXIOMS_2026-06-29.md) blob
  `bc23300becfe4e4db57153c0e94cfcdf2338da71`;
- the [Block-192 full-carrier/right-Schur source](ADMISSIBILITY_D4_FULL_TEMPORAL_CARRIER_SOURCE_HISTORY_WRITE_BOUNDARY_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-25.md);
- the [Block-194 detector/PVM source](ADMISSIBILITY_D4_DETECTOR_CONDITIONED_M2_POINTER_DISCRIMINATOR_BOUNDARY_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-25.md);
- [Block 203](ADMISSIBILITY_D4_L24_REFLECTION_ALGEBRA_EXACT_GLUING_TRACE_DISCRIMINATOR_BOUNDARY_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-26.md)
  at `12419fc0a1f5b2f87ef557bc52732f83dcc8149a`;
  and
- the pre-target Block-204 registration at
  `03c32997ace9a723fa39ce5fbe6afbad9087e6ee`.

The preregistration froze carrier typing before weights, natural full-Fock
lifts, `N=1`, a unital-positive route, and a labeled OS control.  It prohibited
postselection, maximally mixed or equal-sector imports, fitted maps, dense
`2^32` construction, and assertion that the mathematical PVM is already the
physical Admissibility possibility partition.

The exact logical-fiber calculation belongs to the frozen carrier diagram and
map classification.  It does not add a post-target physical law.

## 3. Typed Carriers

Block 192 uses the exterior-form representation

\[
 \Lambda\mathbb C^4,\qquad
 \dim=(1,4,6,4,1)_{\rm grades}=16. \tag{2}
\]

At fixed spatial radius its linear action has eight equivalent two-component
Clifford blocks.  Block 203 second-quantizes one such block:

\[
 \mathbb C^2\longmapsto\Lambda\mathbb C^2\cong\mathbb C^4. \tag{3}
\]

If all eight linear blocks were explicitly declared one-particle summands,
functoriality would instead give

\[
 \Lambda\!\left(\bigoplus_{a=1}^8\mathbb C^2\right)
 \cong\widehat\bigotimes_{a=1}^8\Lambda\mathbb C^2,
 \qquad\dim=4^8=2^{16}. \tag{4}
\]

That is a valid mathematical lift but is not an already-derived physical
carrier in Block 203.

Block 194's event carrier is different again:

\[
 \mathcal H_R=\mathbb C^2_{\rm sector}\otimes\Lambda\mathbb C^4
 \cong\mathbb C^{32}. \tag{5}
\]

Its further fermionic lift has dimension `2^32`.  Equations (3)--(5) must not
be identified by notation.  The new result below is a factorization inside
(5), not a declaration that (3), (4), and (5) are the same physical object.

## 4. Exact Syndrome--Logical Factorization

Let `gamma_0,...,gamma_7` be the Block-191 Majoranas, and let `tau_a` act on
the two-sector factor.  The three commuting involutions underlying the PVM are

\[
\begin{aligned}
 Z_1&=I_2\otimes i\gamma_0\gamma_2\gamma_3,\\
 Z_2&=I_2\otimes i\gamma_1\gamma_2\gamma_5,\\
 Z_3&=S_J=\tau_x\otimes i\gamma_6\gamma_4.
\end{aligned} \tag{6}
\]

The eight effects are their joint spectral projectors,

\[
 F_{st\sigma}={1\over8}(I+sZ_1)(I+tZ_2)(I+\sigma Z_3),
 \qquad s,t,\sigma\in\{\pm1\}. \tag{7}
\]

The runners independently construct

\[
\begin{aligned}
 L_1&=I_2\otimes\gamma_2,\\
 L_2&=-iI_2\otimes\gamma_0\gamma_1\gamma_7,\\
 L_3&=-i\tau_x\otimes\gamma_0\gamma_5\gamma_7,\\
 L_4&=-i\tau_y\otimes\gamma_0\gamma_1\gamma_4.
\end{aligned} \tag{8}
\]

Exactly,

\[
 L_a^\dagger=L_a,\qquad
 \{L_a,L_b\}=2\delta_{ab}I_{32},\qquad
 [L_a,Z_k]=[L_a,F_i]=0. \tag{9}
\]

All sixteen Clifford monomials in the `L_a` are linearly independent globally
and remain a 16-dimensional algebra after compression to every rank-four
`F_i` fiber.  Hence each fiber carries the irreducible complex `Cl_4=M_4`
representation, proving (1).  Equivalently,

\[
 b_1={L_1+iL_2\over2},\qquad
 b_2={L_3+iL_4\over2} \tag{10}
\]

generate a two-mode CAR algebra in the PVM commutant.

This factorization is exact but not canonical as an action identification.
The three-stabilizer Pauli centralizer on five qubits contains
`2^(10-3)=128` phase-free elements.  Logical bases and inter-fiber gauges are
therefore not fixed by the PVM alone.

For any isometry `V:C4 -> C32`, equation (1) permits the form

\[
 UV\psi=\sum_{i=1}^8|i\rangle\otimes K_i\psi,
 \qquad \sum_iK_i^\dagger K_i=I_4, \tag{11}
\]

and then

\[
 V^\dagger F_iV=K_i^\dagger K_i. \tag{12}
\]

Thus the exact missing datum is an action-selected Kraus/intertwiner tuple.
If `V` were required to intertwine the entire logical `M4`, Schur's lemma
would force `K_i=alpha_i I4`; port transitivity would then give
`|alpha_i|^2=1/8`.  A distinguishing law must therefore couple syndrome and
logical factors or intertwine only the smaller physical transfer algebra.

## 5. Strict Full-Fock Projective Lifts

The fixed effects satisfy

\[
 F_i^2=F_i=F_i^\dagger,\quad F_iF_j=0\ (i\ne j),\quad
 \sum_iF_i=I_{32},\quad\operatorname{rank}F_i=4. \tag{13}
\]

On `Lambda(C32)`, the ordinary exterior lifts obey

\[
 \Gamma(F_i)\Gamma(F_j)=P_{\rm vac}\quad(i\ne j),\qquad
 \operatorname{rank}\Gamma(F_i)=16. \tag{14}
\]

Counting the shared vacuum once, their combined range has rank

\[
 1+8(16-1)=121 \tag{15}
\]

out of `2^32`.  Already at degree two, `C(8,2)4^2=448` states with particles
in two distinct ports are omitted.  The alternative projectors

\[
 A_i=I-\Gamma(I-F_i) \tag{16}
\]

cover such states but overlap, with two-port intersection rank
`(2^4-1)^2 2^24>0`.

The original PVM returns exactly on `N=1`, but with sector unit `P_1`, not the
full-Fock unit.  Block 203's periodic per-copy functional has

\[
 {1\over(1-r)^2}(1,-r,-r,r^2),\qquad
 r=\left({\sqrt{53}-2\over7}\right)^{24}, \tag{17}
\]

so its vacuum and pair values are nonzero and

\[
 \omega_P(P_{N=1})={-2r\over(1-r)^2}<0. \tag{18}
\]

`N=1` is therefore a changed state/sector law, not an innocuous restriction.
This strict-projective obstruction revalidates the earlier Block-200 result;
it is not the principal novelty of Block 204.

## 6. Three Positive Full-Fock Extensions

Let `N_i=dGamma(F_i)`, `N=sum_i N_i`, `P_0` be the vacuum projector, and
`Q_i=1_{N_i>0}`.  On the joint occupation spectrum
`n_i in {0,...,4}`, the runners exhaust all `5^8=390625` patterns for three
maps.

The Block-200 complement construction assigns the original port to a
nonvacuum single-port state and `1/8` to every port on vacuum or multi-port
states.  The other two are

\[
 A_i^{\rm number}={P_0\over8}+(I-P_0){N_i\over N}, \tag{19}
\]

and

\[
 A_i^{\rm support}={P_0\over8}+(I-P_0){Q_i\over\sum_jQ_j}. \tag{20}
\]

All three are positive, unital, number-preserving, defined on every sector,
port-permutation covariant, injective as maps from `C8`, additive on the fixed
coarse-event algebra, and equal to `F_i` on `N=1`.  Because the domain is
commutative, positivity also gives complete positivity.  None is projective.

They differ exactly at occupation `(2,1,0,...,0)`:

\[
\begin{array}{c|c}
 \text{map}&(A_1,A_2,A_3,\ldots,A_8)\\ \hline
 \text{complement}&(1/8,1/8,1/8,\ldots,1/8)\\
 \text{number}&(2/3,1/3,0,\ldots,0)\\
 \text{support}&(1/2,1/2,0,\ldots,0).
\end{array} \tag{21}
\]

This proves operator-level underdetermination under the supplied gates.

### Multiplicity-splitting control

A stronger notion of refinement changes the result.  Split the first
occupation `2` into two physically equivalent subports `1+1` and recombine
their weights.  The before/after coarse weights are

\[
 \text{complement}:1/8\ne2/9,\qquad
 \text{number}:2/3=2/3,\qquad
 \text{support}:1/2\ne2/3. \tag{22}
\]

Within the declared ratio family
`g_i(n)=f(n_i)/sum_j f(n_j)`, refinement consistency requires
`f(a+b)=f(a)+f(b)`.  The exact finite constraint matrix on `n=1,...,4` has
nullity one, so `f(n)=c n` and number-share is unique in that ansatz.

Equation (22) is not yet a derivation of the physical law.  Ordinary
probability-measure additivity applies after the physical events and their
partition are identified.  The current chain does not establish that splitting
a particle-occupation multiplicity is merely an equivalent representation of
one Admissibility possibility rather than a different experimental event.
That identification is downstream context content, not something to insert
silently into the minimal axioms.

## 7. Why Periodic Values Remain Sealed

The three map operators differ, but it would be incorrect to infer that an
action-induced state must assign them different values.

For a supplied one-body covariance/monodromy `Q_R` on `C32`, the exact
quasifree count generator would be

\[
 \chi(z)=
 {\det\!\left(I+Q_R\sum_i z_iF_i\right)\over\det(I+Q_R)}
 =\det\!\left(I-C+C\sum_i z_iF_i\right),
 \quad C=Q_R(I+Q_R)^{-1}. \tag{23}
\]

If a map has joint-count eigenvalue `g_i(n)`, then

\[
 p_i=\sum_{\mathbf n}g_i(\mathbf n)
 [z^{\mathbf n}]\chi(z). \tag{24}
\]

The runners construct the `g_i`.  No upstream block supplies the full
same-action `Q_R`, normalized `C32` periodic functional, or the intertwiner
`V`/`K_i` in (11).  Therefore (24) cannot yet be evaluated physically.

There is an exact hostile control.  If a future licensed lift happened to be
`Q_R=-r I32`, then

\[
 \chi(z)={\prod_{i=1}^8(1-rz_i)^4\over(1-r)^{32}}. \tag{25}
\]

This signed functional is port-permutation invariant.  Every covariant unital
POVM then has eight equal expectations summing to one, hence `p_i=1/8`, even
though the operators in (21) differ.  Equation (25) is a control, not an
import: the physical incoming/outgoing sectors need not have scalar-identical
actions.

The exact periodic stop is consequently:

> No full-`C32` periodic covariance/state or action-selected logical-fiber
> intertwiner is supplied, so the fixed Record effects cannot yet be assigned
> periodic values.

It is not “positive maps are absent,” “nonunique maps imply nonunique
probabilities,” or “same-action descent is impossible.”

## 8. Conditional Right-Schur Probability Control

Block 192's positive ordinary-transpose right-Schur boundary Gram has internal
marginal `I16/16` in each sector on the frozen zero-source control.  For a
block-diagonal classical sector population,

\[
 \rho_w=\operatorname{diag}
 \left({wI_{16}\over16},{(1-w)I_{16}\over16}\right),
 \qquad0\le w\le1. \tag{26}
\]

Using the exact Block-194 effects,

\[
 \operatorname{Tr}(\rho_wF_{st\sigma})={1\over8} \tag{27}
\]

for every `w`.  Thus neither equal sector populations nor an imported
maximally mixed `I32/32` state is needed inside this block-diagonal family.

The result is not coherence-independent.  Define

\[
 \rho_\epsilon={I_{32}+\epsilon S_J\over32},
 \qquad |\epsilon|\le1. \tag{28}
\]

It is positive and normalized and has the same diagonal blocks `I16/32`, but

\[
 \operatorname{Tr}(\rho_\epsilon F_{st\sigma})
 ={1+\sigma\epsilon\over8}. \tag{29}
\]

The exact positive result is therefore a zero-source/block-diagonal nuisance-
population cancellation.  A source-selected coherent two-sector state and
its neighbor-condition dependence remain open.

This object is the positive right-Schur boundary marginal.  It is not relabeled
as the periodic fermionic Berezin OS/CAR state, a distinction already required
by Block 197.  Nor does it prove that the PVM is the physical local `M2`
possibility partition, that a Record forms, or that the condition-dependent
Admissibility distribution has been derived.

## 9. Exact Route Disposition

| route | exact result |
|---|---|
| literal `C4=C32` | fails by type/dimension; does not exhaust fiber routes |
| strict `Gamma(F_i)` projectors | shared vacuum and rank-121 incomplete span |
| at-least-one-port projectors | complete coverage but nonexclusive overlaps |
| `N=1` | exact PVM under sector unit; changes the periodic functional |
| full-Fock positive extensions | at least three survive; operator-level nonselection |
| multiplicity-splitting refinement | selects number-share only inside ratio ansatz; physical rule not supplied |
| logical-fiber/Naimark route | exact `C8 tensor C4` factorization survives; action-selected `K_i` missing |
| full quasifree evaluation | exact formula supplied; physical `Q_R` missing |
| right-Schur block-diagonal control | exact uniform `1/8` for every `w` |
| coherent Schur extension | exact `(1+sigma epsilon)/8`; coherence law missing |

The bounded result is positive underdetermination and sharp localization.  It
is not a six-family canonical-descent obstruction.

## 10. No-Go Discipline Gate

The current no-go-discipline skill was freshness-checked and applied.  The
gate passes only for the narrow revalidation that the tested strict
projective full-Fock lifts fail.  It fails every broader descent, probability,
Record, Born, axiom, gravity, or TOE negative because explicit positive routes
survive.

### N1 — normalized alternative-route enumeration

| family | load-bearing mechanism / terminal obligation | marker | result |
|---|---|---|---|
| literal carrier | direct `C4`--`C32` isometry / preserve PVM | ATTEMPTED | typed mismatch |
| exterior projectors | `Gamma(F_i)` / exclusive complete events | ATTEMPTED | vacuum and mixed-port failure |
| occupancy support | `I-Gamma(I-F_i)` / exclusivity | ATTEMPTED | overlaps |
| exact `N=1` | sector compression / unchanged action state | ATTEMPTED | PVM restored; state changed |
| complement POVM | allocate complement uniformly / positive full-carrier law | ATTEMPTED | survives |
| number-share POVM | sample occupation multiplicity / positive full-carrier law | ATTEMPTED | survives; split-consistent in ratio ansatz |
| support-share POVM | sample occupied ports / positive full-carrier law | ATTEMPTED | survives coarse gates |
| logical-fiber/Naimark | `C8 tensor C4` and Kraus tuple / same-action descent | ATTEMPTED | factorization passes; intertwiner open |
| full quasifree state | `Q_R` and determinant generator / exact values | OPEN | no supplied `Q_R` |
| right-Schur state | positive boundary marginal / local distribution | ATTEMPTED | block-diagonal control passes; coherence/context open |
| AP/open/process/gravity | changed carrier or downstream formation/history/geometry | OPEN | untested here |

The surviving constructive rows defeat any broad no-go.

### N2 — wall-independence audit

The honest unresolved objects are:

- `W_carrier`: a full same-action `C32` covariance/state `Q_R`;
- `W_map`: an action/reflection/cubic-covariant isometry `V`, equivalently
  Kraus tuple `K_i`;
- `W_refine`: whether multiplicity splitting is a physically equivalent
  refinement of the same local possibility;
- `W_coherence`: the action-selected two-sector coherence law; and
- `W_context`: identification of the PVM with the local `M2` possibility menu
  and its variation with neighboring condition `eta`.

`W_carrier` and `W_map` are coupled: the action commutant determines the
intertwiner space.  Periodic positivity is downstream of both.  `W_refine`
can reduce the kinematic map family but cannot supply `Q_R`.  `W_coherence` is
part of state selection, while `W_context` is a separate physical-observable
bridge.  These are not falsely counted as five independent conjunctive walls.

### N3 — hidden-condition scan

The following hidden assumptions are rejected:

- “canonical” meaning unique under positivity alone;
- “faithful” meaning projective rather than injective on `C8`;
- fixed coarse-event additivity meaning invariance under every microscopic
  Hilbert-space refinement;
- a direct-sum Clifford multiplicity meaning eight physical Fock factors;
- matching dimension `C4` meaning a supplied action intertwiner;
- map inequivalence meaning state-value inequivalence;
- diagonal sector marginals excluding coherence;
- a positive right-Schur Gram being the periodic Berezin CAR state; and
- a mathematical PVM already being the Admissibility possibility partition.

### N4 — residual matching

Block 200 already proved the strict exterior-natural projective obstruction
and explicitly constructed the full-complement POVM
`Gamma_+(F_i)+P_perp/8`; see
[`ADMISSIBILITY_D4_L24_EXTERIOR_NATURAL_E8_INSERTION_OBSTRUCTION_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-25.md`](ADMISSIBILITY_D4_L24_EXTERIOR_NATURAL_E8_INSERTION_OBSTRUCTION_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-25.md),
especially its full-complement construction.  Block 204 does not rename that
prior result as novelty.  Its new residuals are the two additional positive
maps, their exact refinement discriminator, the logical Clifford
factorization, the scalar-value countercontrol, and the coherent Schur
countercontrol.

### N5 — per-scale execution

The primary cached stdout contains the required substantive lines:

- `per_element:` all eight projectors, three POVMs, symbolic Schur weights,
  and finite coarse events;
- `per_site:` not executed — no `Z3` site embedding or local physical
  possibility partition;
- `per_mode:` the D1 zero-radius per-copy periodic sectors only;
- `per_block:` the full eight-port PVM and exact occupation combinatorics;
  and
- `lattice_wide:` not executed — no formation/history/gravity/TOE closure.

### N6 — rhetoric and partial-closure audit

The result does not use “impossible,” “ruled out,” “canonical obstruction,” or
“only remaining wall” for the full action-to-Record problem.  Exact partial
closures retained are:

- strict-projective failure in the tested natural families;
- existence of at least three positive full-carrier extensions;
- exact logical `C4` inside every PVM fiber;
- selection of number-share under an explicitly conditional refinement
  ansatz;
- independence of block-diagonal `1/8` weights from classical sector
  population; and
- exact sensitivity to sector coherence.

### N7 — strongest steelman

The strongest constructive route is now explicit.  Build the physical
`Q_R`/monodromy on `C32`, solve

\[
 Q_RV=VQ_{203} \tag{30}
\]

together with reflection and cubic covariance, form
`A_i=V^dagger F_iV`, and evaluate the Block-203 functional on all atoms and
coarsenings.  The cheap pre-gate is to compare compressed action spectra and
compute the exact `Hom(Q_203,Q_R)` space before imposing isometry.  A second
steelman derives the multiplicity-refinement equivalence physically, which
would select number-share inside the tested ansatz.

### N8 — cross-cycle echo

The initial Block-204 draft repeated Block 200's projective obstruction while
omitting Block 200's positive complement POVM.  The adversarial audit caught
that error before commit.  The result was retracted, the positive family was
expanded and exhaustively checked, and the theorem was recut from “zero
descents” to positive underdetermination.  This is the required response to a
cross-cycle echo, not a cosmetic wording change.

## 11. Axiom And TOE Disposition

No minimal-axiom amendment is justified.

Admissibility already says there is a probability measure on the local
possibility domain.  Measure additivity applies once physically identical
events and refinements have been supplied.  The unresolved question in (22)
is whether a particle-multiplicity split is in fact an equivalent
representation/refinement of one local possibility.  That is a physical
bridge to derive or register downstream; it is not presently missing grammar
in the axiom memo.

The fixed PVM also still has to be connected to the site's `M2(C)` alternatives
and to a neighbor-conditioned family `eta -> rho_eta`.  Only Records are
readable, but records can support inference of a distribution only after the
formation/context law exists.  The current one-shot controls do not supply
that law.

| TOE lane | before | after | reason |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Records | 95 / 92 / 50 | 95 / 92 / 50 | exact logical host found; no physical state/intertwiner or formation law |
| causal time | 76 / 72 / 41 | 76 / 72 / 41 | unchanged |
| matter | 95 / 96 / 75 | 95 / 96 / 75 | unchanged |
| gravity/source | 70 / 45 / 29 | 70 / 45 / 29 | independently staffed; unchanged here |
| Born/history | 84 / 63 / 34 | 84 / 63 / 34 | positive candidates localized; no retained probability/history theorem |

The lane scores remain frozen because no named obligation is retired.

## 12. Verification And Next Campaign

The primary runner passes `8/8`; the independent reconstruction passes `8/8`.
Mutation sweeps reject `31/31` and `25/25` declared corruptions respectively.
Neither runner constructs a dense `2^32` matrix.  Both exhaust all `5^8`
occupation-count patterns and independently reconstruct every load-bearing
PVM, logical-Clifford, refinement, scalar-control, and Schur-control fact.

The next highest-leverage campaign is the exact `Q_R/V` discriminator:

1. construct or prove absent the physical Block-192/194 `C32` action or
   monodromy for the incoming/outgoing sector pair;
2. compute `Hom(Q_203,Q_R)` and impose reflection/cubic covariance;
3. solve the isometry/Kraus conditions and classify uniqueness modulo the
   action commutant;
4. only then evaluate the eight periodic effects with (23)--(24); and
5. in parallel as a cheaper boundary, test whether the physical Record
   context licenses multiplicity-splitting refinement or coherent sector
   weights.

That campaign directly targets a positively retained action-to-Record law.
Further counting of arbitrary POVMs or strict projective lifts is now lower
leverage.
