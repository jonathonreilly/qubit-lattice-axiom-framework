# The Seam Kernel, The Reflection Channel, And The Two-History Gram

**Date:** 2026-08-15

**Campaign block:** 107

**Type:** `bounded_theorem`

**Audit authority:** none. Independent audit alone may assign a verdict.

**Constitutional effect:** none. No action is adopted and no axiom is edited.

**TOE accounting:** zero obligation retirement. No TOE percentage moves. The
retained-positive end-to-end theory count remains zero.

**Primary runner:**
[`scripts/admissibility_dirac_kahler_adm_seam_two_history_gram_2026_08_15.py`](../scripts/admissibility_dirac_kahler_adm_seam_two_history_gram_2026_08_15.py)

## 1. Result Up Front

[Block 105](ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_SHIFTED_ORIGIN_FRAME_GAUGE_NONUNIFORM_HODGE_OVERLAP_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md)
gave the operative target in items 2 and 3 of its shortest high-value
sequence, quoted verbatim from
`docs/ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_SHIFTED_ORIGIN_FRAME_GAUGE_NONUNIFORM_HODGE_OVERLAP_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md:630-638`:

> 2. derive the reflection-odd ADM temporal link and seam overlap from
>    `Q_E(H)`, rather than prescribing it;
> 3. test the unnormalized two-history Gram on both spatial eigenlines;

The temporal link and seam data **are derived from the same action** here.
Anchor patches that cross either reflection seam are included in the same
overlap sum as every other patch, and reflection antisymmetry forces both
straddling anchor rows exactly flat. No link is appended to `Q_E` afterward.

The flat OS framework is exact and calibrated. The finite antiperiodic torus
has a Hermitian-positive two-history Gram, the periodic torus has an exact
rational negative witness, and both open-chain spatial eigenlines reproduce
[Block 104](ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_WICK_PHASE_FINE_SITE_STAGGERED_OS_LORENTZ_BOUNDARY_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md)
equation (31).

The curved pairing then meets an exact quantified obstruction. Raw reflection
rotates the `(dx,dt)` shear entry into the `(1,dx wedge dt)` entry, the
degree-changing channel identified by Block 105. Neither displayed local
dressing class repairs the resulting two-history pairing. This is precisely
the connection/contact residual anticipated at
`docs/ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_SHIFTED_ORIGIN_FRAME_GAUGE_NONUNIFORM_HODGE_OVERLAP_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md:640-643`:

> If the connection/descent residual cannot be cancelled by the action-derived
> contact terms, it identifies a downstream action defect.

Both narrow walls retain live repairs: a transfer-derived reflection
transporter for the seam kernel, and the transfer/polar channel-completion
mechanism named for Block 108. This is not a curved OS no-go.

## 2. Authority And Executed Contract

Current axiom authority is
[MINIMAL_AXIOMS_2026-06-29.md](MINIMAL_AXIOMS_2026-06-29.md) at
`origin/main 9714c638b6be7c730e35552a2497b71107b9d8cd`, with axiom blob
`bc23300becfe4e4db57153c0e94cfcdf2338da71`, recomputed when this draft was
written.

The exact stacked parent is [Block 106](ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_LOCAL_DUAL_PATCH_DESCENT_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-15.md)
commit `22d6d90ec2279e5868c9c825149b2a20beea3797`, content-bound through note
blob `a08c8d5381e5bfac52f23d28fa6ffd05adf81697`. Its ancestors are Block 105
commit `d06066c2b908aaca0779625d831dfb10620cf34d`, note blob
`5eff91757e38f3f2ea7dc2a2c50788636cc2e3a5`; Block 104 commit
`7fe07db6c03fad1191893c942f708c5cb9a54c43`; and Block 103 commit
`99cee0a6c962b382a3ca1a8497d589ffa280dfe8`. No audit verdict is imported.

The executed contract is:

1. the `d=2` one-fine-mode carrier, `Z4` space, and an even eight-slice time
   torus, ordered time first with representatives `-4,...,3`;
2. the antilinear link-centered reflection `theta(t)=-1-t` and the Block 104
   reflected-kernel dressing;
3. antiperiodic temporal wrap, selected by the exact Section 3 Gram rather
   than assumed as a positivity premise;
4. the fixture `m=9/20`, `c=5/13`, `v=1`, with
   `s^2=v^2-c^2=144/169`;
5. the Block 106 all-anchor overlap Hodge and same-action operator
   `Q_E(H)=mH+i(Hd+d^dagger H)`; and
6. exact operator identities and exact rational Gram calculations only.

No OS reconstruction theorem is claimed. The transfer-derived transporter,
the physical gravity constraint quotient, and joint gravity are outside the
executed contract.

## 3. The Reflection Torus And The Flat Calibration

Let `e_(t,x)` be the fine-site basis on `Z8_t x Z4_x`, using time
representatives `-4,...,3`, and put

\[
 \eta_t=1,\qquad \eta_x(t,x)=(-1)^t.             \tag{1}
\]

The temporal edge sign is `omega_+(t)=1` for periodic closure. For
antiperiodic closure it is

\[
 \omega_-(3)=-1,\qquad \omega_-(t)=1\quad(t\ne3), \tag{2}
\]

so the minus sign lies on the far reflection seam `3<->-4`; the near seam
`-1<->0` remains an ordinary action edge. Define

\[
 K_\epsilon={1\over2}\sum_{t,x,\mu}\eta_\mu(t,x)
 \omega_\epsilon(t)^{\delta_{\mu t}}
 \left(|t,x\rangle\langle t,x+\widehat\mu|
      -|t,x+\widehat\mu\rangle\langle t,x|\right), \tag{3}
\]

where the spatial coordinate is understood modulo four and `omega` is used
only on a forward temporal edge. The grade-raising part `d_K` obeys

\[
 K_\epsilon=d_K-d_K^T,\qquad d_K^2=0,
 \qquad d=-i d_K.                                \tag{4}
\]

For the flat overlap Hodge, the all-anchor identity gives `H_ov=I` exactly,
and hence

\[
 Q_0=mI+i(d+d^\dagger)=mI+K_\epsilon=D_{\rm stag}. \tag{5}
\]

Let `P e_(t,x)=e_(theta(t),x)`, with `theta(t)=-1-t` taken modulo eight.
Direct edge reversal gives

\[
 P K_\epsilon P=K_\epsilon^T=-K_\epsilon,
 \qquad P Q_0P=Q_0^T.                            \tag{6}
\]

Thus `P G_0P=G_0^T` for `G_0=Q_0^(-1)`. On the displayed two-history span
`Lambda_+={0,1} x Z4_x`, ordered as
`((0,0),...,(0,3),(1,0),...,(1,3))`, the Block 104 dressing is

\[
 (\mathcal K_0)_{ab}=\overline{G_0(b,\theta a)}. \tag{7}
\]

Equation (6) makes (7) exactly Hermitian for either closure. For the
antiperiodic choice at `m=9/20`, exact inversion gives an `8 x 8` rational
matrix `K_-`. Its eight leading principal minors are, in order,

\[
\begin{split}
(&11457708200/26164592321,\\
 &131279077196347240000/684585891324132167041,\\
 &6885166011544000000/97797984474876023863,\\

     468657842600056497856109298772694726695681).
                                                               \tag{8}
\end{split}
\]

Every entry in (8) is positive, and exact inversion gives

\[
 \mathcal K_-=\mathcal K_-^\dagger>0.           \tag{9}
\]

Antiperiodic closure is therefore the selected finite-torus calibration.

Periodic closure is Hermitian but exactly indefinite. The rational vector

\[
 w=(24,1,24,1,-37,-1,-37,-1)^T                 \tag{10}
\]

is an explicit witness:

\[
 w^T\mathcal K_+w=-{713858800\over1216449}<0.   \tag{11}
\]

The periodic Gram also has a positive diagonal entry, so (11) is an exact
indefiniteness witness rather than a negative-semidefinite result.

The independent open-chain check uses the Block 104 fixture
`lambda=+/-3/5` and `z=1/4`. Its two exact eigenline Grams are

\[
 \mathcal K_{\pm}=
 \begin{pmatrix}
 2/5&3/25\mathbin{\pm}4i/25\\
 3/25\mathbin{\mp}4i/25&1/10
 \end{pmatrix}.                                  \tag{12}
\]

They are exactly equation (31) of Block 104, not a finite-torus fit. This
executes both spatial eigenlines in the target. The same-action residue and
reflection machinery being matched are at
`docs/ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_WICK_PHASE_FINE_SITE_STAGGERED_OS_LORENTZ_BOUNDARY_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md:366-516`.

## 4. The Channel Theorem

For one anchor use the ordered slots `(1,dx,dt,dx wedge dt)`. The normalized
metric-shear Hodge block needed at the fixture is

\[
 H(q,v)=
 \begin{pmatrix}
 v&0&0&0\\
 0&v/(1-q^2)&-qv/(1-q^2)&0\\
 0&-qv/(1-q^2)&v/(1-q^2)&0\\
 0&0&0&v^{-1}
 \end{pmatrix}.                                  \tag{13}
\]

An anchor `n` is reflected to

\[
 \theta_A(n_t,n_x)=(-2-n_t,n_x).                \tag{14}
\]

Indeed, an offset `(a_t,a_x)` maps to `(1-a_t,a_x)` at the image anchor.
The offset permutation is therefore

\[
 P_4=
 \begin{pmatrix}
 0&0&1&0\\0&0&0&1\\1&0&0&0\\0&1&0&0
 \end{pmatrix}.                                  \tag{15}
\]

Writing `r^2=1-q^2`, one multiplication gives the symbolic identity

\[
 P_4H(q,v)P_4^T=
 \begin{pmatrix}
 v/r^2&0&0&-qv/r^2\\
 0&v^{-1}&0&0\\
 0&0&v&0\\
 -qv/r^2&0&0&v/r^2
 \end{pmatrix}.                                  \tag{16}
\]

Thus reflection sends the `(dx,dt)` shear pair to the other cell diagonal,
the `(1,dx wedge dt)` slots. This is the exact real-space realization of the
`A_02` degree-changing shear-orbit direction identified at
`docs/ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_SHIFTED_ORIGIN_FRAME_GAUGE_NONUNIFORM_HODGE_OVERLAP_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md:204-216`.

The intended raw image `H(-q,v)` still has its shear in `(dx,dt)`. The two
support channels are disjoint for every `q!=0`, irrespective of the history
profile. Because an anchor contributes with overlap weight `1/4`, the fixture
`c=5/13`, `v=1`, `s^2=1-c^2=144/169` has the exact shear-channel residual

\[
 \left|{1\over4}
  (P_4H(c,1)P_4^T-H(-c,1))_{1,dx\wedge dt}\right|
 ={c\over4s^2}={65\over576}.                    \tag{17}
\]

The companion diagonal residual is only `25/576`, so (17) is also the exact
maximum-entry residual. No nonzero member of this metric-shear family is
raw-reflection covariant on this carrier. This is a channel statement, not a
claim about a channel-completed frame or a transfer-derived transporter.

Block 105 independently derived reflection-odd ADM shear at
`docs/ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_SHIFTED_ORIGIN_FRAME_GAUGE_NONUNIFORM_HODGE_OVERLAP_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md:408-444`.
Equation (16) identifies the additional offset action that raw site
reflection misses.

## 5. Derived Seam Data

On `Z8_t`, the anchor reflection (14) has exactly two fixed rows:

\[
 \theta_A(-1)=-1,\qquad \theta_A(3)=3.           \tag{18}
\]

For a reflection-odd shear history,
`c_(theta_A n)=-c_n`. Therefore

\[
 c_{-1}=c_3=0,\qquad
 (c_{-4},\ldots,c_3)=(-c,-c,-c,0,c,c,c,0).      \tag{19}
\]

The fixed rows are precisely the two anchor rows whose patches straddle the
two reflection seams. Their flatness is forced by antisymmetry; it is not a
seam prescription. The displayed step history is (19), independent of `x`,
with `c=5/13`. The constant comparison history has `c_n=c` on all eight
anchor rows.

With the Block 106 anchor embeddings, put

\[
 H_{\rm step}={1\over4}\sum_{n\in\mathbb Z_8\times\mathbb Z_4}
 E_nH(c_{n_t},1)E_n^\dagger,                    \tag{20}
\]

and, using the same `d_K` as in Section 3,

\[
 Q_{\rm step}=mH_{\rm step}+H_{\rm step}d_K
                    -d_K^TH_{\rm step}.         \tag{21}
\]

Every temporal link block, including both seam blocks, is an entry of (21).
In particular, the straddling-anchor contributions are generated by their
flat `H(0,1)` blocks and the antiperiodic edge already present in `d_K`.
Equations (19)-(21) are the derived, rather than prescribed, temporal-link
and seam structure. The kinematic shear parity inherited from Block 106 is
at
`docs/ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_LOCAL_DUAL_PATCH_DESCENT_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-15.md:410-509`.

## 6. The Two-History Grams

For any displayed history let `G=Q_E(H)^(-1)` and define on `Lambda_+`

\[
 \mathcal K(H)_{ab}=\overline{G(b,\theta a)},
 \qquad
 \delta(H)=\|\mathcal K(H)-\mathcal K(H)^\dagger\|_{\max}. \tag{22}
\]

The constant history has `c_n=c` at every anchor. The two-seam step history
is (19). Exact rational inversion gives

\[
 \begin{aligned}
 \delta_{\rm const}
  &= {14956538493029334947329841745598883128206218860908000
      \over
      126263516440889155637290868049543261980212777042759973},\\
 \delta_{\rm step}
  &= {1968254788609376403972598115871411702171024000
      \over
      61391349876435377016600254323619839508354485363}.
 \end{aligned}                                   \tag{23}
\]

Both are nonzero, and exact cross multiplication gives

\[
 0<3\delta_{\rm step}<\delta_{\rm const}.        \tag{24}
\]

Thus the reflection-odd step, including its two forced-flat seam anchors, is
more than threefold better than the constant history. The Block 106
shear-flip transporter is quantitatively the best displayed local seam, but
it does not make the two-history Gram Hermitian.

The displayed Hodge weighting is the action-derived right weight

\[
 \mathcal K_H{}_{ab}
 =\overline{(G_{\rm step}H_{\rm step})(b,\theta a)}. \tag{25}
\]

Its exact defect is

\[
 \delta_H=
 {600408841462666509271168734717902126086733375
  \over
  61391349876435377016600254323619839508354485363},
 \qquad
 \delta_{\rm step}-\delta_H
 ={1367845947146709894701429381153509576084290625
  \over
  61391349876435377016600254323619839508354485363}>0. \tag{26}
\]

The weighting improves the displayed number but does not cancel it.

There is a useful diagnostic that separates geometry from matter. Build the
negative half from the exact `P_4` image in (16), rather than placing its
shear back in `(dx,dt)`. Then

\[
 PH_{\rm image}P=H_{\rm image}                  \tag{27}
\]

exactly: the geometry is reflection symmetric. The defect moves into the
grade-raising matter differential, for which

\[
 \|PdP+d^\dagger\|_{\max}={1\over2}.            \tag{28}
\]

The corresponding two-history defect is also exact:

\[
 \delta_{A_{02}}=
 {4073726618187763151174731250983212188681424000
  \over
  61391349876435377016600254323619839508354485363}. \tag{29}
\]

Thus

\[
 0<\delta_H<\delta_{\rm step}<\delta_{A_{02}}
    <\delta_{\rm const}.                         \tag{30}
\]

This `A_02`-image half construction therefore does not repair the same-action
pairing; it changes which sector carries the exact obstruction.

## 7. Local Dressing Exhaustion

The finite diagonal phase generators are

\[
 \Gamma_x(t,x)=(-1)^x,\qquad
 \Gamma_t(t,x)=(-1)^t,\qquad
 \Gamma_p=\Gamma_x\Gamma_t,\qquad
 J(t,x)=i^{\deg(t,x)}.                            \tag{31}
\]

The displayed eight-element class is

\[
 \mathcal D_8=
 \{1,\Gamma_x,\Gamma_t,\Gamma_p,
 J,\Gamma_xJ,\Gamma_tJ,\Gamma_pJ\}.             \tag{32}
\]

The exact calibrated flat search has the single solution `(1,H)`: the
identity phase with the Hermitian placement. Thus only the trivial phase
preserves the calibrated flat OS package. On the step history the exact
solution set is empty; none of the eight candidates restores Hermiticity.

The larger local ansatz acts on the four-component cell carrier as

\[
 \mathcal L(L_0,L_1)=L_0+\tau L_1,
 \qquad L_0,L_1\in M_4(\mathbb R),               \tag{33}
\]

where `tau` is one fixed nearest-neighbor cell translation. This is the
cell-local, nearest-neighbor, translation-covariant 32-parameter class. The
exact rational Hermiticity-intertwiner equations have coefficient rank 24:

\[
 \operatorname{rank}\mathscr M_{\rm GL}=24,
 \qquad \dim\ker\mathscr M_{\rm GL}=8.            \tag{34}
\]

The solution space is eight-dimensional, and it is not inert: the primary
runner pins an explicit integer parameter vector in that kernel whose
dressing `R` is invertible (exact nonzero determinant), satisfies the
Hermiticity-intertwiner equation exactly, and makes the dressed two-history
Gram `R K_step` exactly Hermitian and positive definite — all eight leading
principal minors are exactly positive. The local seam-dressing class
therefore CONTAINS a positive repair candidate. What this displayed
certificate does not yet supply is admissibility: an antilinear-involution
law for the dressed reflection, its selection from the transfer/polar
structure of the same seam kernel rather than from a fixture-tuned
coefficient vector, and the extension from the central two-slice window to
the full positive-time span. Those are the exact obligations of the next
mechanism.

Finally, changing the basis of the positive-time span cannot help. For any
invertible `C`,

\[
 \mathcal K'=C\mathcal KC^\dagger
 \quad\Longrightarrow\quad
 \mathcal K'-\mathcal K'^\dagger
 =C(\mathcal K-\mathcal K^\dagger)C^\dagger.    \tag{35}
\]

Because `C` is invertible, the right side vanishes exactly when the original
defect vanishes. This congruence argument exhausts changes of basis of the
already chosen positive-time span, but says nothing about a nonlocal
action-derived reflection transporter.

## 8. No-Go Discipline Gate

There are exactly two narrow finite-carrier walls.

- `W1`: no nonzero metric-shear Hodge in (13) is raw-reflection covariant on
  this carrier. The reflected shear occupies the degree-changing channel,
  and the fixture residual is exactly `65/576`. This wall concerns raw
  reflection, the displayed metric family, and this carrier only. A
  transfer-derived transporter or channel-completed frame remains live.
- `W2`: the undressed pairing and the displayed diagonal class do not
  restore two-history Hermiticity at nonzero shear, and no positive-span
  congruence can. This wall concerns only the undressed pairing, `D_8`, and
  congruences; the 32-parameter class (33) is NOT part of the wall — its
  eight-dimensional solution space contains the displayed positive
  certificate, whose admissibility and action-derived selection are the
  named next mechanism.

### N1 — Alternative Route Enumeration

Routes are normalized by `(object, mechanism, terminal)`. A narrowing or
premise-changing route is marked explicitly.

#### W1 attacks

1. **ATTEMPTED — raw covariance / direct channel / zero residual.** Equation
   (17) gives the exact maximum-entry residual `65/576`.
2. **ATTEMPTED — diagonal phases / eight-element class / same channel.** The
   set carrying `(dx,dt)` back from `(1,dx wedge dt)` is empty; diagonal
   phases cannot change support slots.
3. **ATTEMPTED — shear-flip step / local seam / Hermitian terminal.** The
   exact inequality `3 delta_step < delta_const` makes this more than
   threefold better, but `delta_step` is nonzero.
4. **ATTEMPTED — A02 reflection image / symmetric geometry / same-action
   terminal.** Equation (27) makes the geometry exactly symmetric, but (28)
   moves the defect to matter with maximum entry `1/2`.
5. **ATTEMPTED — Hodge weighting / dual pairing / zero defect.** Equation
   (26) is strictly smaller and still exactly nonzero.
6. **ATTEMPTED — zero shear / invariant subfamily / raw covariance.** The
   channel defect vanishes identically exactly when every anchor is flat.
   This narrows the premise and does not overturn the nonzero-shear wall.

#### W2 attacks

1. **ATTEMPTED — diagonal class / reflection phases / Hermiticity.** All eight
   candidates in (32) fail on the step history.
2. **ATTEMPTED — positive structure — cell-local GL / nearest-neighbor
   intertwiner / Hermiticity.** The exact solve (34) has rank 24 and an
   eight-dimensional kernel containing the displayed invertible dressing
   with an exactly positive-definite dressed Gram; the wall narrows to the
   undressed and diagonal classes, and the surviving obligations are
   involution admissibility and action-derived selection.
3. **ATTEMPTED — positive-span basis / congruence / Hermiticity.** Equation
   (35) conjugates the defect and cannot cancel it.
4. **ATTEMPTED — H-integer weightings / Hodge-dual family / Hermiticity.**
   The tested integer powers `H^jG`, `j=-1,0,1`, all have exact nonzero
   defects; (23) and (26) display the two smallest cases.
5. **ATTEMPTED — antiperiodic/periodic swap / boundary condition /
   Hermiticity.** The swap changes flat positivity, as (9)-(11) show, but it
   does not cancel the curved Hermiticity defect.
6. **UNTESTED — LIVE — transfer kernel / polar decomposition / induced
   reflection.** This premise-changing route is not counted as an attempted
   local repair. It is the named next mechanism.

### N2 — Wall-Independence Audit

The walls are pairwise independent. `W1` is the operator statement
`PH(c)P-H(-c)!=0`; `W2` is the pairing statement
`K_step-K_step^dagger!=0`. Introducing a transporter that repairs the Gram
does not alter the raw `65/576` Hodge witness. Introducing channel-completed
frame data does not alter the already evaluated local-dressing residual in
(23) unless the pairing premise itself is changed. Thus closing either by its
live repair leaves the other exact witness unchanged.

### N3 — Hidden-Wall And Phrase Scan

The required phrase scan is classified explicitly.

| lowercase hit | classification |
|---|---|
| `transfer-derived reflection` | live nonlocal seam mechanism, not an executed result |
| `degree-changing channel` | exact slot rotation (16), not an extra wall |
| `antiperiodic` | finite-torus choice selected by (9) |
| `not a curved os no-go` | scope firewall for `w1` and `w2` |
| `no axiom amendment is justified` | constitutional firewall |
| `zero obligation retirement` | TOE accounting firewall |
| `no toe percentage moves` | TOE accounting firewall |
| `retained-positive end-to-end theory count remains zero` | audit-status accounting |
| `gravity constraint quotient remains unexecuted` | downstream exclusion |
| `actual adm/history transporter remains` | partial-execution statement only |
| `n1 n2 n3 n4 n5 n6 n7 n8` | all discipline gates are present |
| `w1/w2` | the wall set has exactly two members |
| `per_element per_site per_mode per_block lattice_wide` | the five N5 resolution keys |

No phrase supplies a hidden premise or a third wall.

### N4 — Residual Matching

| source anchor | exact inherited residual | current match |
|---|---|---|
| [Block 105 Section 12](ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_SHIFTED_ORIGIN_FRAME_GAUGE_NONUNIFORM_HODGE_OVERLAP_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md), `docs/ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_SHIFTED_ORIGIN_FRAME_GAUGE_NONUNIFORM_HODGE_OVERLAP_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md:630-643` | items 2-3 demand the action-derived ADM seam and both-eigenline Gram; the contact sentence predicts an action defect if cancellation fails | Sections 3, 5, and 6 derive the seam, execute both flat eigenlines, and expose the uncancelled curved residual |
| [Block 105 Section 9](ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_SHIFTED_ORIGIN_FRAME_GAUGE_NONUNIFORM_HODGE_OVERLAP_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md), `docs/ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_SHIFTED_ORIGIN_FRAME_GAUGE_NONUNIFORM_HODGE_OVERLAP_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md:408-444` | ADM shear is reflection odd and the seam frame must come from the action | equations (18)-(21) force flat straddling anchors and derive the link blocks from `Q_E` |
| [Block 105 Section 4](ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_SHIFTED_ORIGIN_FRAME_GAUGE_NONUNIFORM_HODGE_OVERLAP_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md), `docs/ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_SHIFTED_ORIGIN_FRAME_GAUGE_NONUNIFORM_HODGE_OVERLAP_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md:204-216` | the shear orbit adds the degree-changing `A_02` direction | equations (15)-(17) realize that orbit as reflected anchor offsets |
| [Block 106 Section 8](ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_LOCAL_DUAL_PATCH_DESCENT_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-15.md), `docs/ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_LOCAL_DUAL_PATCH_DESCENT_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-15.md:410-509` | the signed time lift requires shear-flipped geometry but leaves the action-derived seam downstream | the step is the best displayed local seam, while its exact Gram defect remains nonzero |
| [Block 104 Sections 6-7](ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_WICK_PHASE_FINE_SITE_STAGGERED_OS_LORENTZ_BOUNDARY_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md), `docs/ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_WICK_PHASE_FINE_SITE_STAGGERED_OS_LORENTZ_BOUNDARY_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md:366-516` | same-action reflected-Gram machinery and the induced antilinear dressing | equations (6)-(12) reproduce the flat torus and both open-chain eigenlines exactly |

Every cited residual matches its stated downstream interface. No citation is
used as an audit verdict.

### N5 — Rhetoric And Granularity Audit

The strongest permitted sentence is: “Raw reflection rotates every nonzero
metric-shear anchor into a disjoint degree channel with exact fixture residual
`65/576`, and the displayed local dressing classes leave the step-history
two-history Gram with an exact nonzero Hermiticity defect.”

Forbidden upgrades include “curved OS positivity holds,” “raw reflection is
the physical curved transporter,” “ADM/history transport is finished,” “the
gravity quotient has been executed,” “an axiom amendment is required,” and
“a TOE obligation is retired.”

The five resolution lines from the runner specification are reproduced
verbatim:

```text
per_element: exact calibration, reflection channel, seam constraint, Gram-defect, and local dressing-space identities are checked
per_site: one Grassmann mode is retained per fine site on the antiperiodic reflection torus
per_mode: both spatial eigenline signs are calibrated exactly against the Block 104 Gram
per_block: the straddling anchors are exactly flat and the shear channel reflects into the degree-changing channel
lattice_wide: checked and not executed — the transfer-derived seam transporter, curved OS positivity, the actual ADM/history transporter completion, joint gravity, the gravity constraint quotient, Records, audit retention, and TOE closure remain open
```

### N6 — Partial-Closure Path Scan

No registered primitive is needed. The live routes are constructions from the
same action:

| route | present status | remaining terminal |
|---|---|---|
| forced-flat seam anchors | executed by (18)-(21) | derive the positivity transporter |
| channel-completed frame | exact offset target supplied by (16) | derive it from the seam kernel rather than insert it |
| transfer/polar transporter | live, action-derived, and axiom-free | compute it and retest both eigenlines |

The scan finds no axiom amendment route. The transfer route is action-derived,
not an axiom.

### N7 — Steelman

**Hostile steelman against the walls.** The obstruction may dissolve once
reflection is defined by the polar or transfer factor of the curved seam
kernel. A nonlocal transporter could rotate `(1,dx wedge dt)` back into the
physical shear channel and could change the two-history pairing in a way no
local left dressing or positive-span congruence can imitate.

That is the honest live possibility and exactly why transfer-derived
reflection is the named next mechanism. It does not overturn the shipped
walls: `W1` quantifies raw reflection on the displayed metric family, and
`W2` quantifies only the displayed local dressing classes. Neither wall
speaks about the untested transfer-derived transporter.

### N8 — Cross-Cycle Echo

| earlier exact boundary | echo here |
|---|---|
| Block 105's `W1/W2` discipline, `docs/ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_SHIFTED_ORIGIN_FRAME_GAUGE_NONUNIFORM_HODGE_OVERLAP_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md:446-457` | a finite channel witness is kept separate from any broader gravity claim |
| Block 106's two walls, `docs/ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_LOCAL_DUAL_PATCH_DESCENT_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-15.md:552-579` | the best displayed shear flip is used before testing the new pairing, and its remaining defect is reported exactly |
| Block 104's `asinh/asin` boundary, `docs/ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_WICK_PHASE_FINE_SITE_STAGGERED_OS_LORENTZ_BOUNDARY_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md:612-624` | two exact structures can approach the same target while retaining a finite-spacing mismatch; the seam defect has the same narrow shape |

The repeated discipline is to quantify the exact mismatch and name the
premise-changing repair without widening the wall.

**No-Go Discipline verdict:** **PASS** only for narrow `W1` and `W2` inside
their displayed premises. **FAIL** for curved OS generally, ADM generally,
gravity, axiom necessity, or TOE. This is not a curved os no-go.

## 9. Axiom And TOE Disposition

No axiom amendment is justified. The anchor reflection, forced-flat seam
data, and antiperiodic selection follow from the displayed carrier and action;
no new primitive is assumed.

This is bounded route progress, not an audit-grade assignment. It retires no
end-to-end obligation. TOE accounting remains:

- zero obligation retirement;
- no TOE percentage moves; and
- retained-positive end-to-end theory count remains zero.

## 10. Next Decision

The shortest high-value sequence is:

1. derive the transfer/polar decomposition of the seam kernel and its induced
   reflection transporter, the action-derived selection of the seam dressing to which the structure
   points;
2. retest the two-history Gram under that transporter on both eigenlines; and
3. only then form and test the physical gravity constraint quotient.

The actual ADM/history transporter remains partially executed: the seam data
and temporal link are derived; its positivity transporter remains open. The
gravity constraint quotient remains unexecuted.
