**Date:** 2026-08-17

**Campaign block:** 128

**Type:** `bounded_theorem`

**Audit authority:** none. Independent audit alone may assign a verdict.

**Constitutional effect:** none. No action is adopted and no axiom is edited.

**TOE accounting:** zero obligation retirement. No TOE percentage moves. The
retained-positive end-to-end theory count remains zero.

**Primary runner:**
[`scripts/admissibility_dirac_kahler_curved_carrier_dependency_2026_08_17.py`](../scripts/admissibility_dirac_kahler_curved_carrier_dependency_2026_08_17.py)

## 1. Result Up Front

[Block 127](ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_NATURALITY_MODULI_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-17.md)
closed onto the following handoff next gate, anchored byte-exactly at
`docs/ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_NATURALITY_MODULI_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-17.md:16`
and elaborated in its Next Decision:

> The moduli-adjointness hinge (does any moduli member admit the descending
> member O*?); the curved-carrier dependency; the cross-lane facet-charge
> bridge.

**THE CURVED-CARRIER DEPENDENCY THEOREM.** On the certified curved carrier
of [Block 105](ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_SHIFTED_ORIGIN_FRAME_GAUGE_NONUNIFORM_HODGE_OVERLAP_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md),
the flat OS apparatus of Blocks 118--127 does not extend through the
displayed natural shifted-chart completions. The obstruction has three
exact, mutually reinforcing certificates.

First, no global curved action exists in the executed package. The common
nilpotent patch/frame differential required to identify the shifted charts
is unexecuted. Before that identification, the displayed natural
shifted-chart completions are pairwise inequivalent. Their first displayed
difference is exactly

\[
 -\frac{89}{140},                              \tag{1}
\]

while every completion remains pentadiagonal. Bandedness survives; a
single chart-independent action does not.

Second, if \(K^{(a)}\) denotes any displayed completion and \(S_x\) the
spatial shift on the displayed 32-dimensional carrier, then

\[
 \operatorname{rank}[K^{(a)},S_x]=32.          \tag{2}
\]

Thus the translation defect is full rank for every displayed completion.
There is no common spatial-momentum decomposition and therefore no
per-momentum continuation of the flat program.

Third, the position-space two-slice Schur forward coefficients are
singular at the displayed steps in both directions and for every displayed
completion. With

\[
 e_2=(0,1,0,0)^{\mathsf T},                    \tag{3}
\]

the exact coordinate-kernel certificate is

\[
 F^{(a)}_{j,\rightarrow}e_2=0,
 \qquad
 F^{(a)}_{j,\leftarrow}e_2=0                  \tag{4}
\]

at each displayed step \(j\). The same coordinate direction survives every
displayed regrouping. Hence no invertible one-step forward solve exists,
and no one-step companion, monodromy, stable split, or swap completion is
defined.

The exact pipeline census is therefore

\[
 \boxed{
 \text{band OK}
 \;\longrightarrow\;
 \text{companions FAIL}
 \;\longrightarrow\;
 \text{momentum FAIL}
 \;\longrightarrow\;
 \text{everything downstream undefined}.}     \tag{5}
\]

The ordering in (5) is a dependency census, not a claim that the companion
and translation failures have only one causal relation. The full-rank
translation defect independently removes momentum sectors; the fixed
Schur kernel independently removes one-step propagation. Either blocks the
flat OS pipeline, and together they make its nonextension exact on the
displayed carrier.

This identifies Block 105 §12 item 1 as the proven bottleneck:

> 1. derive the common nilpotent patch/frame differential or its exact
>    connection residual;

The common differential remains the named live construction. Its
impossibility is not claimed. The theorem establishes the order in which
the curved lane must be built: every curved-OS step waits on that
differential.

The differential construction, the scalar-quotient block, the cross-lane
facet-charge bridge, the completed ADM/history transporter, joint gravity,
the gravity constraint quotient beyond the displayed carrier, Records,
audit retention, axiom amendment, obligation retirement, and TOE percentage
movement remain outside this theorem.

## 2. Authority And Executed Contract

Current axiom authority is
[MINIMAL_AXIOMS_2026-06-29.md](MINIMAL_AXIOMS_2026-06-29.md), inherited
content-bound from the certified chain. No newer authority claim is made
here, and no audit verdict is imported.

The content-bound curved authority is
[Block 105](ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_SHIFTED_ORIGIN_FRAME_GAUGE_NONUNIFORM_HODGE_OVERLAP_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md).
Its certified carrier is the shifted-origin frame gauge with the nonuniform
overlap Hodge. Its §12 item 1 supplies the byte-exact common-differential
gate quoted above. Block 105 is authority for this bounded carrier and that
ordered residual only; it is not an effective-status grant.

The exact trace parent is
[Block 127](ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_NATURALITY_MODULI_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-17.md).
Its flat half-space package, completion moduli, monodromy lift, stable split,
and swap completion are the apparatus whose curved extension is tested.
The present theorem does not import those flat constructions as curved
objects.

The executed contract is:

1. the certified Block 105 curved carrier, namely the shifted-origin frame
   gauge with the nonuniform overlap Hodge;
2. every displayed natural shifted-chart completion of that carrier;
3. the pairwise comparison of those completions and the exact first
   displayed difference \(-89/140\);
4. preservation of pentadiagonal support for every displayed completion;
5. the spatial-shift commutator test, with exact full rank 32 for every
   displayed completion;
6. the resulting absence of a spatial-momentum decomposition and of the
   whole per-momentum continuation of Blocks 118--127;
7. the position-space two-slice Schur forward coefficients at every
   displayed step, in both directions and for every displayed completion;
8. the fixed coordinate-kernel witness \((0,1,0,0)\) and its survival under
   every displayed regrouping;
9. the consequent nondefinition of a one-step companion, monodromy, stable
   split, and swap completion on that displayed curved package; and
10. one narrow wall W1, with the common nilpotent differential, a different
    curved fixture, companion-free OS methods, the scalar-quotient block,
    and the cross-lane bridge left live.

The assigned primary runner is the path recorded in the front matter. This
note does not invent a replay footer or a `TOTAL` line: under the supplied
note-only contract, its scientific content is the supervisor-verified
certificate stated above. The five fixed N5 resolution lines are
reproduced verbatim in Section 9 so the runner and note have one textual
contract.

The scope is the displayed Block 105 carrier, its displayed shifted-chart
completions, the displayed two-slice steps and regroupings, and the attempted
extension of the flat Blocks 118--127 apparatus. No result on a different
curved fixture, a completed common differential, direct Gram OS methods,
the scalar quotient, the facet-charge bridge, history transport, joint
gravity, or a gravity quotient beyond the displayed carrier follows.

## 3. No Global Curved Action

Block 105 §12 item 1 states, byte-exactly:

> 1. derive the common nilpotent patch/frame differential or its exact
>    connection residual;

The source anchor is
`docs/ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_SHIFTED_ORIGIN_FRAME_GAUGE_NONUNIFORM_HODGE_OVERLAP_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md:632-633`.
That gate has not been executed. In particular, the displayed chartwise
differentials have not been replaced by one nilpotent operator on the
redundant patch carrier, and no exact connection residual has been supplied
which would make their action data descend.

Let \(\mathcal K_a\) denote the natural completion displayed in shifted
chart \(a\). The exact comparison certificate is

\[
 \mathcal K_a\ne\mathcal K_b
 \qquad(a\ne b),                               \tag{6}
\]

with the first nonzero displayed comparison equal to

\[
 \Delta_{\mathrm{first}}
 =-\frac{89}{140}\ne0.                         \tag{7}
\]

Equation (7) is an exact rational difference. It is not a floating
tolerance, a fit, or a sign-only mismatch. The remaining displayed
comparisons preserve (6): no two displayed chart completions coincide.

At the same time, every \(\mathcal K_a\) is pentadiagonal. Hence

\[
 \text{pentadiagonal support}
 \not\Longrightarrow
 \text{chart-independent action}.             \tag{8}
\]

The support statement controls distance from the diagonal. It does not
identify coefficients across shifted frames and cannot substitute for the
missing common differential or connection residual.

Thus no global curved action exists in the executed Block 105 package: the
available objects are inequivalent chartwise completions without the
transition-compatible nilpotent datum needed to glue them. This is a
statement about what the displayed package defines. It is not a proof that
no common differential, connection correction, or global action can ever
be constructed.

The distinction matters. A future common differential could show that the
raw difference (7) is removed or controlled by the correct transition law.
Until that construction is executed, treating one \(\mathcal K_a\) as the
global curved action would choose a chart rather than derive an action.

## 4. The Translation Breakdown

Let \(S_x\) be the spatial shift on the displayed 32-dimensional carrier.
For every displayed natural completion,

\[
 C_a:=[\mathcal K_a,S_x],
 \qquad
 \operatorname{rank}C_a=32.                   \tag{9}
\]

The commutator is therefore full rank. This is stronger than finding one
matrix entry that violates translation covariance: the translation defect
has no null direction on the displayed carrier.

A spatial Fourier basis may still be written as a change of coordinates.
What fails is the decomposition of \(\mathcal K_a\) into independent
momentum sectors. If such a decomposition were preserved by the spatial
shift, \(\mathcal K_a\) would commute with \(S_x\); equation (9) excludes
that condition, and does so at full rank.

Accordingly, every construction in the flat Blocks 118--127 program which
is defined one spatial momentum at a time loses its input. There is no
per-momentum two-slice recurrence, no per-momentum companion matrix, no
per-momentum monodromy, no per-momentum stable/unstable split, and no
assembly of the flat swap completion from independent momentum sectors.

This is not a theorem against position-space analysis. It is the exact
failure of the momentum reduction used by the flat apparatus on the
displayed curved completions. Section 5 tests the corresponding
position-space route directly.

## 5. The Companion Obstruction

For a displayed completion \(a\), step \(j\), and either propagation
direction \(\varepsilon\in\{\rightarrow,\leftarrow\}\), write the
two-slice Schur relation schematically as

\[
 F^{(a)}_{j,\varepsilon}\psi_{j+1}
 +G^{(a)}_{j,\varepsilon}\psi_j
 +H^{(a)}_{j,\varepsilon}\psi_{j-1}=0.         \tag{10}
\]

The forward coefficient in (10) must be invertible to solve uniquely for
the next slice and form a one-step companion. Instead, the exact displayed
certificate is

\[
 \det F^{(a)}_{j,\varepsilon}=0,
 \qquad
 F^{(a)}_{j,\varepsilon}e_2=0,
 \qquad
 e_2=(0,1,0,0)^{\mathsf T},                    \tag{11}
\]

at every displayed step, in both directions, and for every displayed
completion. The coordinate witness is fixed: it is not selected anew for
different charts, steps, or orientations.

The usual companion construction would contain
\((F^{(a)}_{j,\varepsilon})^{-1}\). Equation (11) says that inverse does not
exist. Therefore the one-step companion is not defined. Without a sequence
of one-step companions, their ordered product is not a monodromy. Without
that monodromy, there is no stable/unstable spectral split, and without the
split and its boundary data there is no swap completion of the flat kind.

The obstruction holds in both propagation directions. Reversing the
two-slice orientation does not exchange a bad forward coefficient for an
invertible one. It also holds for every displayed shifted-chart
completion, so choosing another displayed chart does not restore the
companion pipeline.

Equation (11) does not say that the position-space equations have no
solutions. It says that the displayed Schur relation does not determine a
unique next slice and therefore cannot define the one-step evolution which
the flat OS apparatus requires.

## 6. The Consequence Logic

The fixed kernel gives the obstruction a direct operational meaning. If
\(\psi_{j+1}\) solves (10), then the forward contribution is unchanged
under

\[
 \psi_{j+1}\longmapsto\psi_{j+1}+t e_2,
 \qquad t\in\mathbb C,                         \tag{12}
\]

because \(F^{(a)}_{j,\varepsilon}e_2=0\). Thus the displayed two-slice
equation is underdetermined along the same coordinate direction at every
displayed step. A one-step rule cannot be recovered by selecting a
numerical inverse: there is no inverse to select.

The displayed regroupings do not remove this freedom. They rebracket the
same finite position-space relations into alternative two-slice cells.
For each displayed rebracketing, the recomputed forward coefficient still
annihilates \(e_2\):

\[
 \widetilde F^{(a)}_{J,\varepsilon}e_2=0.       \tag{13}
\]

This is stronger than observing a singular coefficient before grouping.
It is an exact survival certificate for the kernel after every regrouping
actually displayed in the carrier.

The rebracketing logic has a sharp dichotomy. Invertible row or coordinate
changes carry a nonzero kernel direction to a nonzero kernel direction and
cannot raise a singular coefficient to full rank. Any attempted Schur
rebracketing that instead requires inversion of the coefficient in (11)
is already undefined. The explicit certificate (13) shows that the
displayed regroupings fall on the first side: the coordinate witness
survives.

Therefore underdetermination is not a presentation artifact of one chosen
two-slice cell. The displayed position-space route has no unique local
forward map, in either direction, for any displayed completion. That is
the strongest obstruction because it survives after momentum methods have
already been abandoned.

The conclusion remains narrow. A different blocking, a different curved
fixture, an enlarged state, or a companion-free construction is not among
the displayed regroupings and is not excluded by (13).

## 7. The Pipeline Census

The exact census separates preserved input from failed constructions and
undefined descendants:

| pipeline stage | exact certificate | status on displayed carrier |
|---|---|---|
| local band | every chart completion is pentadiagonal | **OK** |
| chart gluing | pairwise inequivalent; first difference \(-89/140\) | **FAIL** without common differential |
| one-step forward solve | fixed kernel \((0,1,0,0)\), both directions | **FAIL** |
| companion construction | requires the singular forward inverse | **FAIL / undefined** |
| spatial-momentum reduction | spatial-shift commutator rank 32 | **FAIL** |
| monodromy | requires defined one-step companions | **undefined** |
| stable split | requires a defined monodromy | **undefined** |
| swap completion | requires the flat stable/boundary package | **undefined** |
| curved OS continuation | requires the common differential and prior stages | **undefined** |

In the compressed campaign notation, this is exactly

\[
 \text{band OK}
 \to\text{ companions FAIL}
 \to\text{ momentum FAIL}
 \to\text{ everything downstream undefined}. \tag{14}
\]

“Everything downstream” means every descendant of the displayed flat OS
pipeline. It does not quantify over every possible direct position-space,
Gram, enlarged-state, or alternative curved construction.

The census also prevents two tempting but invalid inferences.
Pentadiagonality does not supply translation covariance, and translation
failure does not by itself establish the companion obstruction. The
former is a support property; the latter two have the independent exact
certificates (9) and (11)--(13).

## 8. What The Dependency Means

Block 105 named the common nilpotent patch/frame differential first in its
Next Decision. Blocks 118--127 then completed a substantial OS apparatus
on the flat carrier. The present theorem asks whether that apparatus can
simply be carried back to the certified curved fixture. Equations
(6)--(14) answer no for the displayed completions.

The answer turns Block 105 §12 item 1 from an ordered suspicion into the
proven gateway for this lane. The common differential must provide the
transition-compatible object from which a global curved action can be
defined. Only after that input exists can a curved OS package, a curved
gravity constraint quotient, or the actual ADM/history transporter be
derived from one common action.

The positive content is an ordering theorem:

\[
 \boxed{
 \text{common differential first}
 \;\Longrightarrow\;
 \text{curved action}
 \;\Longrightarrow\;
 \text{curved OS pipeline}.}                  \tag{15}
\]

Equation (15) records dependency, not sufficiency. Constructing the common
differential would reopen the next tests; it would not automatically prove
reflection positivity, a constraint quotient, or a transporter.

The honest scope is equally important. This block does not say “curved OS
is impossible” and does not say “the differential cannot exist.” It says
that the displayed Block 105 chart completions and regroupings do not
inherit the flat apparatus without that construction. A theorem about
ordering has replaced an informal concern; no universal wall has been
erected.

The common differential is therefore a live, named construction. The
scalar-quotient theorem block and the cross-lane facet-charge bridge remain
separate live successors. The actual ADM/history transporter and the
curved constraint quotient remain downstream, not imported from the flat
results.

## 9. No-Go Discipline Gate

There is exactly one bounded curved-carrier wall.

- W1 — **DISPLAYED CURVED-CARRIER NONEXTENSION WALL:** the flat Blocks
  118--127 apparatus does not extend to the displayed Block 105 curved
  completions. The exact mechanisms are pairwise chart inequivalence with
  first difference \(-89/140\) despite pentadiagonality, full-rank-32
  failure of spatial-shift commutation, and singular two-slice Schur
  forward coefficients with the fixed coordinate kernel \((0,1,0,0)\)
  surviving every displayed regrouping.

W1 is narrow to the displayed natural shifted-chart completions, the
displayed steps in both directions, and the displayed regroupings on the
certified Block 105 carrier. It does not quantify over another curved
fixture, another blocking, an enlarged state, or a direct Gram method.

W1 is not an OS no-go and not a curved OS no-go. It does not claim
that curved OS is impossible. It does not claim that the
common nilpotent differential cannot exist. It also does not import the
flat results as curved results. The common differential is live and named:
it is the first construction required to decide whether the displayed
chart differences are transition data rather than a terminal defect.

Equivalently: the displayed curved package has banded chartwise operators,
but it has neither the global action, the momentum sectors, nor the unique
position-space evolution required to instantiate the flat OS pipeline.

### N1 — Alternative Route Enumeration

Routes are normalized by (object, mechanism, terminal). The three exact
mechanisms, their consequence logic, the census, and the live repair remain
separate.

1. **PROVED — companion obstruction / singular two-slice Schur forward
   coefficient with the fixed coordinate kernel \((0,1,0,0)\) at every
   displayed step, in both directions and every displayed completion / no
   one-step companion, monodromy, stable split, or swap completion is
   defined.** This is the strongest obstruction because the witness
   survives every displayed regrouping.
2. **PROVED — translation breakdown / full-rank-32 commutator with the
   spatial shift for every displayed completion / no decomposition into
   independent spatial-momentum sectors.** The whole per-momentum flat
   program loses its input.
3. **PROVED — no-global-action inequivalence / pairwise comparison of the
   natural shifted-chart completions with exact first difference
   \(-89/140\), while pentadiagonality is preserved / no chart-independent
   curved action exists in the executed package.** Banded support does not
   glue charts.
4. **PROVED — consequence logic / add the fixed kernel direction to a next
   slice and re-evaluate every displayed regrouping / the forward solve
   remains underdetermined and rebracketing supplies no companion.** This
   rules out a presentation-only diagnosis for the displayed regroupings.
5. **PROVED — pipeline census / order the preserved band property, failed
   companion and momentum stages, and undefined descendants / band OK,
   companions FAIL, momentum FAIL, everything downstream undefined.** The
   census is narrow to descendants of the displayed flat pipeline.
6. **UNTESTED-LIVE — common differential construction / derive the common
   nilpotent patch/frame differential or its exact connection residual /
   decide chart descent and reopen the curved OS tests.** No impossibility
   result is imported into this route.

The scalar-quotient theorem block, cross-lane facet-charge bridge, actual
ADM/history transporter, joint gravity, and gravity constraint quotient
beyond the displayed carrier remain downstream of row 6. W1 consumes none
of those routes.

### N2 — Wall-Independence Audit

W1 is independent of Block 127's displayed-criterion nonselection wall,
anchored in that note's No-Go Discipline Gate.

[Block 127](ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_NATURALITY_MODULI_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-17.md)
classified flat reflection-reality-covariant completion moduli and asked
whether four displayed naturality criteria selected the inherited swap.
Its mechanisms were the moduli dimension, a nonselective inversion locus,
the stable-eigenline contradiction, and the normalized-minimality split.
Its terminal was the absence of an unconditional displayed selection.

The present W1 does not classify completion moduli and does not apply any
of those selection criteria. It asks whether the already built flat
apparatus extends to the displayed Block 105 curved carrier. Its mechanisms
are chart inequivalence, a full-rank translation commutator, and a
regrouping-stable Schur kernel. Its terminal is nondefinition of the flat
pipeline on that displayed curved package.

The walls therefore have different objects and mechanisms:

\[
 \begin{array}{c|c|c}
 \text{block} & \text{mechanism} & \text{terminal}\\\hline
 127 & \text{moduli and criterion classification} &
       \text{no unconditional displayed selection}\\
 128 & \text{chart, translation, and Schur defects} &
       \text{flat pipeline not defined on displayed carrier}
 \end{array}                                   \tag{16}
\]

There is an intentional dependency. Block 127 supplies the flat objects
whose curved extension is tested; Block 128 shows that the displayed
curved package does not define those objects. Dependency does not merge the
walls. A criterion may select a flat completion conditionally while no
curved companion or swap exists to receive that selection.

| per_element per_site per_mode per_block lattice_wide | five N5 keys |

No phrase upgrades nonextension on the displayed carrier into curved-OS
impossibility. Nothing turns a missing construction into proof that the
construction cannot exist. Nothing turns pentadiagonality into a global
action or a Fourier basis into independent momentum sectors.

Nothing asserts completion of the common differential, scalar quotient,
facet-charge bridge, ADM/history transporter, joint gravity, a gravity
constraint quotient beyond the displayed carrier, axiom amendment, audit
retention, obligation retirement, or TOE percentage movement.

### N4 — Residual Matching

The Block 127 handoff next gate, quoted byte-exactly, is:

> The moduli-adjointness hinge (does any moduli member admit the descending
> member O*?); the curved-carrier dependency; the cross-lane facet-charge
> bridge.

| source anchor | exact inherited residual | current match |
|---|---|---|
| [Block 127 next gate](ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_NATURALITY_MODULI_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-17.md), `docs/ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_NATURALITY_MODULI_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-17.md:16` | “The moduli-adjointness hinge (does any moduli member admit the descending member O*?); the curved-carrier dependency; the cross-lane facet-charge bridge.” | the curved-carrier dependency is decided for the displayed Block 105 completions; the moduli-adjointness hinge and cross-lane bridge remain live |
| [Block 105 §12 item 1](ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_SHIFTED_ORIGIN_FRAME_GAUGE_NONUNIFORM_HODGE_OVERLAP_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md#12-next-decision), `docs/ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_SHIFTED_ORIGIN_FRAME_GAUGE_NONUNIFORM_HODGE_OVERLAP_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md:632-633` | “derive the common nilpotent patch/frame differential or its exact connection residual;” | NOW PROVEN to be the bottleneck for extending the flat OS apparatus to the displayed curved carrier; the construction itself remains unexecuted and live |

The four ordered items in Block 105 §12 now have the following campaign
status:

| Block 105 §12 item | campaign status after Block 128 |
|---|---|
| 1. derive the common nilpotent patch/frame differential or its exact connection residual | **NOW PROVEN THE BOTTLENECK**; the construction remains unexecuted and live |
| 2. derive the reflection-odd ADM temporal link and seam overlap from \(Q_E(H)\) | executed by the Block 106--114 arc |
| 3. test the unnormalized two-history Gram on both spatial eigenlines | executed by the Block 107--115 arc |
| 4. couple the physical gravity constraint quotient and test obligation movement | executed by Blocks 121--124 on the flat carrier only; no beyond-carrier quotient or TOE movement follows |

After the campaign, item 2 was executed by the arc 106-114, item 3 by the
arc 107-115, and item 4 by the arc 121-124 on the flat carrier. Item 1 is
NOW PROVEN the bottleneck, while its construction remains live.

This is the beautiful closure: the campaign validated Block 105's ordering.
Items 2--4 were executed on their certified flat surfaces, while the
attempted return to the curved carrier proves that item 1 is the gateway
those later results cannot bypass.

This is a partial closure of Block 127's next gate. The curved-carrier
dependency is exact for the displayed completions and regroupings. The
moduli-adjointness hinge, cross-lane bridge, common-differential
construction, different curved fixtures, and companion-free OS routes are
not decided.

### N5 — Rhetoric And Granularity Audit

The strongest permitted sentence is: “On the certified Block 105 curved
carrier, the flat Blocks 118--127 OS apparatus does not extend through the
displayed shifted-chart completions: they are pairwise inequivalent with
exact first difference \(-89/140\) despite remaining pentadiagonal, their
spatial-shift commutators have full rank 32 so no momentum decomposition
exists, and every displayed two-slice Schur forward coefficient in both
directions has the regrouping-stable coordinate kernel \((0,1,0,0)\), so no
one-step companion, monodromy, stable split, or swap completion is defined;
the common differential is therefore the proven live bottleneck, not an
impossible construction.”

Forbidden upgrades include:

- “curved OS is impossible”;
- “the differential cannot exist”; and
- “the flat results are curved results.”

The first universalizes a wall proved only for the displayed completions
and regroupings. The second turns an unexecuted live construction into an
impossibility theorem. The third erases the exact nonextension certificates
(6)--(13).

Also forbidden are “no curved fixture can admit the pipeline,” “every
position-space OS method requires a companion,” “the difference
\(-89/140\) cannot be gauge,” “pentadiagonality implies a global action,”
“a Fourier basis restores independent momentum sectors,” “the common
differential has been constructed,” and “the gravity constraint quotient
is complete beyond the displayed carrier.” None is established here.

The five N5 resolution lines fixed for the runner are reproduced verbatim:

```text
N5: per_element: shifted-chart completions are pairwise inequivalent with exact first difference -89/140, every completion remains pentadiagonal, and every spatial-shift commutator has full rank 32
per_site: one Grassmann mode per fine site on the certified curved carrier
per_mode: checked and not defined — the displayed completions admit no spatial-momentum decomposition
per_block: every displayed completion in both directions has singular two-slice Schur forward coefficients at the displayed steps with fixed coordinate kernel (0,1,0,0), and that kernel survives every displayed regrouping
lattice_wide: checked and not executed — the common nilpotent patch/frame differential, scalar-quotient theorem block, cross-lane facet-charge bridge, actual ADM/history transporter completion, joint gravity, gravity constraint quotient beyond the displayed carrier, Records, audit retention, and TOE closure remain open
```

### N6 — Partial-Closure Path Scan

No registered primitive is needed. The result diagnoses the exact order of
the displayed curved construction without promoting the common differential
or any repair route to an axiom.

| route | present status | remaining terminal |
|---|---|---|
| certified Block 105 carrier | exact curved input | no global action imported |
| shifted-chart completions | pairwise inequivalent | derive transition-compatible common differential |
| first completion difference | exactly \(-89/140\) | decide its transition or gauge meaning |
| local band | pentadiagonal for every completion | supplies no chart gluing |
| global curved action | absent from executed package | construct common differential or connection residual |
| spatial-shift covariance | commutator rank 32 | no independent momentum sectors |
| position-space Schur solve | singular in both directions | no unique next-slice evolution |
| coordinate kernel | fixed \((0,1,0,0)\) | survives every displayed regrouping |
| one-step companion | not defined | requires a repaired forward solve or another method |
| monodromy and stable split | not defined | require companions or a different construction |
| curved swap completion | not defined | requires a curved boundary/stable package |
| common differential | untested-live | execute Block 105 §12 item 1 |
| companion-free direct Gram OS | open and named | test as a possible bypass |
| scalar-quotient theorem block | not executed | run after the dependency is explicit |
| cross-lane facet-charge bridge | not executed | join the certified interfaces |
| actual ADM/history transporter | not executed | complete from one curved action |
| gravity constraint quotient | displayed flat carrier only | execute beyond that carrier |

The scan finds no axiom-amendment route. The curved-dependency clause of
Block 127's next gate is discharged only for the displayed Block 105
completions and regroupings. The remaining terminals are the common
differential, scalar quotient, cross-lane bridge, companion-free bypass,
actual transporter, and gravity beyond the displayed carrier.

### N7 — Steelman

**Hostile steelman: a different curved fixture might admit the pipeline.**
Another gauge, Hodge, blocking, or enlarged state might commute with its
spatial shift and have invertible two-slice forward coefficients.

Agreed. W1 covers the displayed Block 105 carrier, completions, steps, and
regroupings only. It is not a quantification over all curved fixtures. A
different fixture is a live construction, not a counterexample to narrow
W1.

**Hostile steelman: a companion-free OS approach might bypass the strongest
obstruction.** Direct position-space Gram methods could establish a
half-space positivity statement without defining a one-step companion or
monodromy.

Agreed. The theorem proves failure of the displayed flat apparatus, whose
pipeline uses those objects. A direct Gram construction is open and named.
No claim here says that every OS proof must factor through a companion.

**Hostile steelman: the exact \(-89/140\) inequivalence might be gauge.**
The completions are displayed in shifted charts, so raw matrix inequality
need not be physical inequivalence after the correct transition law is
known.

Agreed. The displayed package currently has no common nilpotent
patch/frame differential or connection residual which could make that
identification. Constructing it would decide whether (7) is gauge,
connection data, or a genuine action defect. W1 says only that the current
displayed completions do not already define the global action.

These steelmen preserve narrow W1. They identify live alternative inputs
and methods without changing the exact full-rank commutators or the
regrouping-stable kernel on the carrier actually tested.

### N8 — Cross-Cycle Echo

The campaign separated construction of the curved carrier, completion of
the flat OS apparatus, and the test of whether that apparatus returns to
the curved carrier.

| campaign block | narrowing that leads to W1 and the live route |
|---|---|
| [Block 105](ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_SHIFTED_ORIGIN_FRAME_GAUGE_NONUNIFORM_HODGE_OVERLAP_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md) | certified the shifted-origin/nonuniform-overlap carrier and placed the common nilpotent patch/frame differential first in its Next Decision |
| Blocks 118--127 | built and narrowed the flat OS package through the classified completion moduli |
| Block 128 | proves that package does not extend to the displayed curved completions and identifies Block 105 §12 item 1 as the live gateway |

The present result does not infer a global action from bandedness. The
exact chart inequivalence blocks that inference in the executed package.
Nor does it infer that changing basis restores momentum sectors: the
full-rank commutator excludes invariant independent sectors. Finally, it
does not infer inconsistency from the Schur kernel; the exact consequence
is underdetermination and nondefinition of the one-step pipeline.

**No-Go Discipline verdict:** **PASS** only for narrow W1. The flat Blocks
118--127 apparatus does not extend to the displayed Block 105 shifted-chart
completions and regroupings, by the exact chart, translation, and companion
mechanisms stated above. **POSITIVE** for preserved pentadiagonality, exact
first difference \(-89/140\), full commutator rank 32, the fixed
regrouping-stable kernel \((0,1,0,0)\), and the resulting dependency order.
**LIVE** for the common nilpotent differential, a different curved fixture,
a companion-free direct Gram approach, the scalar quotient, and the
cross-lane bridge. **FAIL** for curved-OS impossibility, impossibility of the
differential, import of flat results as curved results, exhaustion of all
curved fixtures or OS methods, a completed action or transporter, joint
gravity, a quotient beyond the displayed carrier, axiom necessity, audit
retention, obligation retirement, or TOE movement.

## 10. Axiom And TOE Disposition

No axiom amendment is justified. Pairwise chart inequivalence, exact first
difference \(-89/140\), pentadiagonal support, full-rank-32 translation
failure, singular Schur forward coefficients, and survival of the fixed
kernel under displayed regroupings are finite consequences of the
displayed Block 105 carrier and completions. No new primitive is assumed.

Naming the common differential as the proven bottleneck diagnoses the
dependency order. It is not authorization to add that differential as an
axiom, to prescribe a chart transition, or to declare its construction
impossible before the live route is executed.

This is bounded route closure, not an audit-grade assignment. It retires no
end-to-end obligation. TOE accounting remains:

- zero obligation retirement;
- no TOE percentage moves; and
- retained-positive end-to-end theory count remains zero.

## 11. Next Decision

The shortest high-value sequence is:

1. derive the common nilpotent patch/frame differential or its exact
   connection residual, as required by Block 105 §12 item 1;
2. execute the scalar-quotient theorem block on the resulting common curved
   action; and
3. execute the cross-lane facet-charge bridge on that surviving package.

The actual ADM/history transporter remains unexecuted beyond the displayed
flat half-space positive package and the Block 105 curved carrier without a
common nilpotent differential.

Reflection positivity on the curved carrier remains unexecuted; in
particular, neither a repaired companion pipeline nor a companion-free
direct Gram certificate has been derived from one common curved action.

The gravity constraint quotient remains unexecuted beyond the displayed
carrier.
