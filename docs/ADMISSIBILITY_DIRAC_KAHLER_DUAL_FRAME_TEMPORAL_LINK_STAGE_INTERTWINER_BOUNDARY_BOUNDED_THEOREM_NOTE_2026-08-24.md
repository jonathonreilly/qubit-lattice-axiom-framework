## Exact target and obligation graph

**Target.**  On the reconstructed Block-128 carrier, determine whether its
projective cover reflection descends to the antiperiodic quotient and supplies,
without an added selector, both the ordinary Block-78 stage exchange and a
positive physical reflected form; if it does not, exhibit one exact repair and
localize the next missing lemma.

| obligation | disposition | exact evidence |
|---|---|---|
| rebuild the carrier reflection without importing PR #7347 | closed | (R=P_{\rm edge}T_t), (R^2=-I), (R^T=-R) |
| classify every live temporal band and its dual-frame character | closed | equations (2)--(3), with all residuals exactly zero |
| prove descent to the declared AP quotient | closed | equations (9)--(11) |
| test direct action on ordinary two-stage labels | closed negatively in the declared linear class | 32 variables, rank 32, nullity zero |
| exhibit an honest stage-exchange repair | closed constructively | displayed primal/dual-adjoint doubling, equations (6)--(8); no minimality claim |
| select an involutive positive physical source port from that repair | open | the doubled intertwiner space has dimension 32 and the raw Gram has inertia `(8,8,0)` |
| close total Ward/recoil and Record-readable rank from the same action | open | no source or Record map is imported or inferred |

The result is bounded to the reconstructed `8x4` cover, its 16-dimensional AP
quotient, the declared reflection-closed section average, and the stated
linear intertwiner/reflected-form classes.  Degenerate changes of spin
structure, mass, section, support, source algebra, or four-dimensional lift
are not silently identified with this fixture.  In particular, the live
`+/-2` bands forbid a nearest-neighbour truncation, and neither a positive
spectral half nor the extra stage sign `D` may be selected after seeing the
spectrum.

Two load-bearing fixtures are frozen explicitly.  The chart differential is
`d_00=d[(0,0)]`.  In the AP ordering by time and then space, the reflected
history restriction is `N_-={0,1,...,7}`: the first two AP time slices and all
four spatial sites.  These are fixture choices, not derived laws; changing
either requires a new run and may change finite-matrix defect counts.

The strongest missing lemma is an action-derived element of the compatible
reflection-real and Gram-Hermitian family that is involutive, positive on a
preregistered conserved gravity-source algebra, total-Ward compatible, and
nonzero under the Record readout.  Block 189 attacks its cheapest algebraic
precursor before spending on four-dimensional or long-history tests.

## Result first

The carrier-derived projective reflection does more than Block 187 could
previously justify, but less than a direct identification with its provisional
stage scalar.

On the independently rebuilt Block-128 `8x4` cover,

\[
 R=P_{\rm edge}T_t,
 \qquad T_t=\operatorname{diag}((-1)^t),
 \qquad R^2=-I,
 \qquad R^T=-R.                                      \tag{1}
\]

The Hodge target is not defined by the claimed equality.  With

\[
 M=\begin{pmatrix}0&0&-1&0\\0&0&0&-1\\1&0&0&0\\0&1&0&0\end{pmatrix},
 \quad H^\vee(q,v)=M H(q,v)M^T,
 \quad (\theta g)(t,x)=g((2-t)\bmod4,x),
\]

the runner rebuilds \(H^\vee[\theta g]\) cell by cell and verifies
\(R H[g]R^{-1}=H^\vee[\theta g]\) independently.  It defines
\(d^\vee=Rd_{00}R^{-1}\); the completed-action covariance is therefore a
formal consistency consequence of the independent Hodge theorem and the
declared co-transport, not a second independent constraint.  If
\(\Pi_\Delta\) selects entries with column-time minus row-time \(\Delta\), then
for the Hodge, co-transported differential, and completed action,

\[
 R\Pi_\Delta(A)R^{-1}=\Pi_{-\Delta}(A^\vee).        \tag{2}
\]

After removing the temporal shift from a band,

\[
 C_\Delta=\Pi_\Delta(A)U_t^\Delta,
 \qquad
 RC_\Delta R^{-1}=(-1)^\Delta C^\vee_{-\Delta}.     \tag{3}
\]

Thus the nearest-neighbour link coefficient is genuinely reversal-odd.  The
reflection and every band descend exactly to the 16-dimensional
antiperiodic quotient.  Moreover, \(J_R=iR_{\rm AP}\) is a derived Hermitian
involution with two eight-dimensional eigenspaces, exchanged by anti-linear
reversal.

That is real progress: the candidate orientation sign is no longer merely a
free scalar.  It is a concrete projective carrier observable.  It is not yet
the Block-78 stage sign, however.  A nonzero direct intertwiner from the
single-carrier reflection to ordinary two-stage exchange is impossible:

\[
 \Phi R_{\rm AP}=X_s\Phi,
 \quad X_s^2=I,
 \quad R_{\rm AP}^2=-I
 \quad\Longrightarrow\quad \Phi=0.                  \tag{4}
\]

The exact coefficient matrix has 32 variables, rank 32, and nullity zero.
Equivalently, forcing the Block-114 reflection form \(AP\) to equal \(R\)
uniquely gives \(A=-T_t\).  Although \(A^2=I\), it is reflection-odd,

\[
 P\bar A P=-A,                                       \tag{5}
\]

and its reflection-even reality equation fails on exactly 32 diagonal
entries.  A scalar phase cannot change the anti-linear square because the
phase cancels against its conjugate.

One constructive repair is a primal/dual-adjoint frame doublet.  No smaller
extension or non-scalar cocycle is classified here.  With

\[
 \mathcal Q=\operatorname{diag}(Q,Q^{\vee\dagger}),
 \qquad
 \mathcal S=
 \begin{pmatrix}0&R_{\rm AP}^T\\R_{\rm AP}&0\end{pmatrix},
 \qquad
 \epsilon_F=\operatorname{diag}(I,-I),               \tag{6}
\]

one obtains

\[
 \mathcal S^2=I,
 \quad \mathcal S\mathcal Q^\dagger\mathcal S=\mathcal Q,
 \quad \mathcal S\epsilon_F\mathcal S=-\epsilon_F. \tag{7}
\]

Therefore

\[
 W_0=I+\epsilon_F,
 \qquad W_1=I-\epsilon_F                             \tag{8}
\]

are exchanged exactly and restrict to `(2,0)` on the primal frame and `(0,2)`
on the dual frame.  This derives the algebraic shape of Block 187's directed
stage repair.  It does not derive the gravity/DK source map identifying frame
with canonical stage.  The doubled stage-intertwiner solve has nullity 32, so
covariance alone still does not select that physical port.

Finally, the doubling repairs Hermiticity but not positivity.  Its declared
reflected form is nonsingular Hermitian and anticommutes with the restricted
frame grading.  Its two off-diagonal blocks both have rank eight, forcing exact
inertia `(8,8,0)`.  The direct single-carrier reflected form is rank eight and
has 40 nonzero Hermiticity-defect entries.  All four orientation-sector blocks
of the AP action have rank eight, so the carrier is action-visible; no physical
source or Record-readable rank is claimed.

The result is therefore partial narrowing plus a constructive repair, not a
gravity failure, DK no-go, Record law, section selector, positive OS theory,
axiom amendment, or TOE closure.  The retained-positive end-to-end theory
count remains zero, no obligation retires, and no TOE percentage changes.

## Authority and prior art

The calculation freezes `origin/main` at
`c79384cb8ffa27fcb53cb89c53a84a708442eaad` and stacks on Block 187 at
`add760976c80ab3a6076aad595b446acca7c41ef`.  It independently rebuilds the
reflection from the landed [Block-128 carrier](ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_CURVED_CARRIER_DEPENDENCY_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-17.md)
rather than importing PR #7347's runner as a premise.  The exact downstream
consumer is the [Block-187 stage-orientation boundary](ADMISSIBILITY_COMMON_ACTION_STATIONARITY_GRAVITY_STAGE_ORIENTATION_BOUNDARY_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-24.md).

- [Block 107](ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_ADM_SEAM_TWO_HISTORY_GRAM_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-15.md)
  already derived a temporal seam and tested a two-history Gram.
  Therefore mere link extraction is not counted as novelty.
- [Block 114](ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_POSITIVE_DRESSED_REFLECTION_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-15.md)
  already exhibited positive reflection-even dressings.  Therefore
  mere positivity existence is not counted as novelty.
- Block 187 derived the `(2,0)` cadence and correctly left its
  reversal-odd carrier unselected.
- Branch-local PR #7347 supplied the fresh dual-frame clue, but it is not
  treated as retained authority and its claimed identities are remeasured.

The new content is the exact intersection: independently targeted Hodge dual
covariance, formal differential/action co-transport, bandwise AP descent,
direct stage-intertwiner classification, the unique direct-dressing failure,
and the displayed doubled-frame repair with its exact balanced Gram.

## Exact temporal-band census

The full reflection-closed section average is used so the calculation does not
mistake one open section point for a reflection selector.  At mass `2/7`:

| object | temporal displacement: nonzero entries / rank |
|---|---|
| \(H_S\) | `-1: 32/32`, `0: 32/32`, `+1: 32/32` |
| \(d\) | `-1: 16/16`, `0: 16/16` |
| \(Q_S\) | `-2: 16/16`, `-1: 72/32`, `0: 80/32`, `+1: 72/32`, `+2: 16/16` |

Every per-band residual in (2) is zero.  The Hodge target is the independent
cell-dual/reflected-field construction above; the differential target is the
declared co-transport and the action target is its formal completion.  For the
stripped `+1` action coefficient, the residual against the negative dual coefficient is zero; the
wrong positive sign has 72 nonzero entries.

The same-frame shortcuts fail before any Gram is built:

| proposed same-frame map | `+` residual | `-` residual |
|---|---:|---:|
| \(R\Pi_{+1}(H_S)R^{-1}\stackrel?=\pm\Pi_{-1}(H_S)\) | `64 / rank 32` | `64 / rank 32` |
| \(R\Pi_{+1}(Q_S)R^{-1}\stackrel?=\pm\Pi_{-1}(Q_S)\) | `80 / rank 32` | `104 / rank 32` |

Closure is to the distinct dual frame.  The minus sign of (3) belongs to the
stripped local coefficient, not to the whole shifted band.  Conflating those
two representations would manufacture the desired stage sign by notation.

The `+/-2` action bands are both live at rank 16.  Truncating the action to
nearest-neighbour links is therefore not an admissible consequence of this
calculation.

## Antiperiodic descent and projective orientation

Let

\[
 \iota_{\rm AP}=\binom{-I_{16}}{I_{16}},
 \qquad
 \sigma_{\rm AP}=(0,I_{16}),
 \qquad
 R_{\rm AP}=\sigma_{\rm AP}R\iota_{\rm AP}.          \tag{9}
\]

The residual in \(R\iota_{\rm AP}=\iota_{\rm AP}R_{\rm AP}\) is zero, and

\[
 R_{\rm AP}R_{\rm AP}^T=I,
 \qquad R_{\rm AP}^2=-I.                             \tag{10}
\]

For every one of the 20 nonzero temporal bands across
\(H,d,Q,H^\vee,d^\vee,Q^\vee\), and for all six unbanded operators, the runner
also verifies independently

\[
 B\iota_{\rm AP}=\iota_{\rm AP}
 (\sigma_{\rm AP}B\iota_{\rm AP}).                 \tag{10a}
\]

All 26 descent residuals are exactly zero; descent is not inferred merely from
the reflection equation.

Hence

\[
 J_R=iR_{\rm AP},
 \qquad J_R^\dagger=J_R,
 \qquad J_R^2=I.                                    \tag{11}
\]

The `+1` and `-1` eigenspaces both have dimension eight.  Anti-linear
reversal maps one to the other exactly.  This supplies a canonical orientation
doublet on the declared carrier, but its projective square is the reason it
cannot map directly to the ordinary two-stage representation.

The four projected action blocks

\[
 P_a Q_{\rm AP}P_b,
 \qquad a,b\in\{+,-\},                               \tag{12}
\]

all have rank eight.  Thus neither orientation is deleted by this action and
the mixing is nonzero.  This is action visibility only.  A DK-to-gravity
stress map, conserved source, Record mark, clock, probability, and permanent
write are absent and cannot be inferred from these ranks.

## Stage representation and displayed repair

For Block 78,

\[
 X_s=\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\1&0\end{pmatrix},
 \qquad w(\epsilon)=(1+\epsilon,1-\epsilon).         \tag{13}
\]

Whole-link exchange has the `Xs` shape, whereas stripped odd coefficients
carry `-Xs`.  The two are similar:

\[
 D(-X_s)D^{-1}=X_s,
 \qquad D=\operatorname{diag}(1,-1).                 \tag{14}
\]

The residual is zero, but `D` is an additional frame/stage sign intertwiner;
it is not selected by the single carrier.  Equation (4) makes that typing
failure exact rather than rhetorical.

The doubled action (6) repairs the square and reflection-reality conditions
without selecting a scalar sign.  The exact solve

\[
 \Phi\mathcal S=X_s\Phi                              \tag{15}
\]

has 64 real-linear coefficient variables, rank 32, and nullity 32.  Thus the
repair admits stage ports but does not choose one.  Equations (7)--(8) show a
canonical frame-stage representation; identifying its content map with the
physical gravity stress still requires the total Ward/recoil and Record
interface solve.

## Positivity boundary

On the single AP carrier, the declared reflected propagator block
`(R_AP Q_AP^-1)|_-` has rank eight and 40 nonzero entries in `K-K^dagger`.
It is not a Block-114 positive reflection form.

For the doubled action, `K=(S Qcal^-1)|_-` is exactly Hermitian, rank 16, and

\[
 \epsilon_{F,-}K\epsilon_{F,-}=-K.                  \tag{16}
\]

Both off-diagonal frame blocks have rank eight and are adjoints.  Equation
(16) pairs every positive eigenvalue with a negative eigenvalue and
nonsingularity excludes zero, so the exact inertia is `(8,8,0)`.  A positive
spectral compression or non-scalar dressing is a live route, not a result of
this block.  Such a source algebra must be preregistered or derived from the
action/Record interface; choosing it after observing the spectrum would be a
selection import.

## No-Go Discipline Gate

The broad statement “the dual-frame route cannot yield the stage carrier or a
positive theory” fails this gate and is not shipped.  The narrow literal
statements measured above pass: direct single-carrier identification has zero
intertwiner, same-frame band closure fails on the declared carrier, and the
displayed doubled reflected form is balanced.  Every broader route remains
explicit.

### N1 — Alternative route enumeration

| normalized route | status | result against the narrow direct-identification claim |
|---|---|---|
| same-frame whole-band `+/-` closure | ATTEMPTED | both signs fail at full rank; only the dual-frame target closes |
| AP quotient/descent | ATTEMPTED | descent succeeds exactly but preserves `R_AP^2=-I`, so it does not create an ordinary stage intertwiner |
| scalar phase redefinition | ATTEMPTED | `(e^{i phi}R) overline(e^{i phi}R)=R bar(R)=-I`; the phase cancels |
| explicit stage-basis sign `D` | ATTEMPTED | equation (14) works, but it adds the very intertwiner excluded by “direct” |
| primal/dual-adjoint doubling | ATTEMPTED | it repairs the square and stage exchange, but changes the carrier and leaves 32 port dimensions plus balanced inertia |
| reflection-even positive dressing | RULED OUT ONLY AS DIRECT EQUALITY BY (5) | Block 114 is a live family-level escape, not a negative witness |
| graded/Kramers or Record-restricted positivity | UNTESTED LIVE ROUTE | it changes the positivity obligation and therefore forbids any broader no-go |

These families differ in primary representation, mechanism, or terminal
obligation.  The untested last route makes a family-wide negative premature;
the claim is deliberately demoted to partial narrowing.

### N2 — Wall-independence audit

| pair | first automatically closes second? | second automatically closes first? | disposition |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| projective-square mismatch / same-frame dual mismatch | no | no | independent direct-identification conditions |
| projective-square mismatch / OS positivity | no | no | positivity is downstream and not part of the narrow exclusion |
| same-frame dual mismatch / source-Record visibility | no | no | separate interfaces |
| OS positivity / source-Record visibility | no | no | separate later obligations |

The narrow direct stage-intertwiner theorem uses only the square mismatch.
The same-frame band result is a second literal matrix theorem.  Positivity and
Record visibility are not inflated into supporting walls.

### N3 — Hidden-wall scan

“Background,” “canonical,” “by construction,” “registered,” and related
phrases were checked.  The only load-bearing inputs are the explicit
Block-128 carrier, full reflection-closed section average, AP quotient,
completion convention, chart origin `d_00=d[(0,0)]`, and the reflected-history
restriction `N_-={0,1,...,7}` (the first two AP time slices and all four
spatial sites).  Each is named and pinned.  “Canonical” for `J_R` and the doubled frame grading means
only that they are algebraic functions of the frozen matrices; it does not
mean Nature selects their gravity/source interpretation.  No standard-QFT or
unnamed framework premise supplies a proof step.

### N4 — Residual matching

| prior item | its residual | present residual | match / use |
|---|---|---|---|
| Block 107 (`docs/ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_ADM_SEAM_TWO_HISTORY_GRAM_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-15.md:478-489`) | curved seam two-history Gram and dressing locality | projective stage intertwiner | no; prior art only |
| Block 114 (`docs/ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_POSITIVE_DRESSED_REFLECTION_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-15.md:492-500`) | existence of positive reflection-even dressings | equality with reflection-odd `A=-T_t` | no; live escape, not negative support |
| Block 187 (`docs/ADMISSIBILITY_COMMON_ACTION_STATIONARITY_GRAVITY_STAGE_ORIENTATION_BOUNDARY_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-24.md:70-90`) | underived orientation scalar and stage typing | action of derived cover reflection on stages | yes as the open interface, not as a negative witness |
| PR #7347 (`scripts/admissibility_dirac_kahler_derived_reflection_seam_dual_2026_08_24.py:1096-1110` on its branch) | independently targeted Hodge dual covariance | temporal bands, AP descent, stage and Gram tests | context and regression target only; the cell-dual/reflected-field target is rebuilt locally |

No mismatched prior no-go is used to support the direct exclusion.

### N5 — Rhetoric and resolution audit

per_element: checked the exact reflection, band, and stage-intertwiner matrix entries.

per_site: checked all 32 cover sites and the 16 antiperiodic quotient sites.

per_mode: checked both eight-dimensional projective orientation eigenspaces exactly.

per_block: checked every live temporal band and both primal/dual frame blocks exactly.

lattice_wide: checked and not executed — no width ladder, four-dimensional lift, or Record history is claimed.

No unchecked resolution is negated.  In particular, this is not a
lattice-wide DK, gravity, positivity, source, or Record theorem.

### N6 — Partial-closure paths

Four non-axiom closure paths remain live: land and later retire the explicit
stage-basis intertwiner `D`; derive a dual-frame source port from the common
action; solve for a non-scalar positive dressing inside the compatible
reflection sector; or derive a Record-eligible source algebra whose reflected
form is positive.  Each would be attached-law content followed by a bounded
theorem and import-retirement audit unless independently derived.  This block
does not claim that an axiom amendment is required and does not edit the
minimal axioms or primitive registry.

### N7 — Steelman

A hostile reviewer should reject any broad no-go here.  The doubled frame
already converts the projective square into an honest reflection and derives
the exchanged operator weights.  Block 114 proves that globally supported
positive dressings exist on the neighboring carrier, and the present balanced
Hermitian form has a canonical positive spectral half.  A total-Ward source
intertwiner or Record-selected observable algebra could make that half the
physical source space while preserving the frame reversal.  The unclosed
terminal obligations are to derive that selection from one action, prove
nonzero conserved gravity-source and Record-readable rank, and retest
positivity without post-selection.  This steelman defeats the broad no-go and
sets the next exact campaign.

### N8 — Cross-cycle echo

Two local lessons block overclaiming.  Blocks 107--114 turned an apparent local
dressing obstruction into a globally supported positive witness, so support
enlargement can retire a wall.  Block 187 turned an apparent DK--gravity
cross-Hessian obstruction into a typing correction from Hessian to vertex, so
interface retyping can retire a wall without new physics.  The doubled-frame
stage representation may play the same role here.  It is therefore tested as
the constructive escape rather than dismissed.

No-go-discipline status: `PASS` for the narrow direct-identification and
balanced-doubling statements; `FAIL` for any family-wide or physical no-go,
which is not claimed.

## Assumptions, imports, and open interfaces

| item | status |
|---|---|
| Block-128 cover, Hodge, differential, mass | explicit reconstructed input |
| full reflection-closed section average | explicit section fixture, not selected law |
| antiperiodic quotient | explicit spin-structure fixture |
| Block-78 stage exchange and `(2,0)` cadence | parent regression target |
| dual-adjoint frame doubling | derived candidate construction in this block |
| stage/content source intertwiner | open; 32-dimensional covariance space |
| action-derived section/dressing selection | open |
| total Ward/recoil and 4D gravity quotient | open |
| physical source and Record-readable rank | open |
| OS reconstruction beyond the displayed Gram | open |
| probability, clock, permanent write, refinement, nonlinear law | open |

## Reproduction

```bash
python3 scripts/admissibility_dirac_kahler_dual_frame_temporal_link_stage_intertwiner_boundary_2026_08_24.py
python3 scripts/admissibility_dirac_kahler_dual_frame_temporal_link_stage_intertwiner_boundary_2026_08_24.py --list-mutations
python3 scripts/admissibility_dirac_kahler_dual_frame_temporal_link_stage_intertwiner_boundary_2026_08_24.py --mutation break_band_character
```

The baseline must end `TOTAL: PASS=7 FAIL=0`.  Each declared mutation rewrites
one claim and must end `TOTAL: PASS=6 FAIL=1` with only its mapped gate down.

## Review record

This block drops two tempting stronger claims.  It does **not** identify the
projective carrier directly with the Block-78 scalar stage sign, because the
ordinary-stage intertwiner has nullity zero.  It also does **not** infer a
family-wide positivity, DK, gravity, or Record no-go from the balanced doubled
Gram; Block 114's non-scalar positive dressings and the unresolved physical
source algebra remain explicit escapes.  The surviving claim ends at exact
finite-carrier dual covariance, AP descent, direct-intertwiner exclusion, and
the constructive doubled-stage boundary.

Hard landing conditions are: a fresh authority pin, literal audit inputs,
canonical cache envelope, nine independent mutation falsifiers, the full
N1--N8 record for every negative sentence, citation-manifest generation, and
repository conformance checks.  No review-loop or audit verdict is part of
this package.

## Next decisive campaign

Do not run another band census.  The highest-leverage successor is the exact
intersection of:

1. reflection reality and the dual-frame/stage intertwiner;
2. Gram Hermiticity and involution;
3. positivity on a preregistered physical source algebra;
4. total Ward/recoil plus nonzero gravity-source rank; and
5. Record-readable rank.

The cheap first kill is the linear reflection/Hermiticity/intertwiner solve.
Only a nonempty linear survivor unlocks the bilinear involution solve, and only
an involutive survivor unlocks positivity and the gravity/Record port.  A
residual continuum is not section or law selection.
