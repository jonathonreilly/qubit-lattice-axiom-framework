## 1. Result Up Front

[Block 105](ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_SHIFTED_ORIGIN_FRAME_GAUGE_NONUNIFORM_HODGE_OVERLAP_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md)
ended at this sharp gate, quoted verbatim from
`docs/ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_SHIFTED_ORIGIN_FRAME_GAUGE_NONUNIFORM_HODGE_OVERLAP_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md:387-400`:

Its [N7 hostile steelman](ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_SHIFTED_ORIGIN_FRAME_GAUGE_NONUNIFORM_HODGE_OVERLAP_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md)
made the terminal obligations equally explicit at
`docs/ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_SHIFTED_ORIGIN_FRAME_GAUGE_NONUNIFORM_HODGE_OVERLAP_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md:585-591`:

All four obligations are executed exactly. The structural fact is simple:
every fine site lies in exactly four anchor patches. Therefore the
**unweighted** analysis map `A`, with every incidence entry equal to `1/2`,
is an exact isometry, and its adjoint is already the local dual. No operator
inverse appears anywhere in this unweighted construction.

The four headline identities are

\[
 A^\dagger A=I,                                      \tag{1}
\]

\[
 d_{\rm ext}=AdA^\dagger,\qquad d_{\rm ext}^{\,2}=0,
 \qquad [N_{\rm ext},d_{\rm ext}]=d_{\rm ext},
 \qquad d_{\rm ext}A=Ad,                            \tag{2}
\]

\[
 \begin{aligned}
 A^\dagger H_{\rm patch}A&=H_{\rm ov},\\
 A^\dagger\!\left[mH_{\rm patch}
  +i\left(H_{\rm patch}d_{\rm ext}
  +d_{\rm ext}^\dagger H_{\rm patch}\right)\right]A
 &=Q_E(H_{\rm ov},d),
 \end{aligned}                                      \tag{3}
\]

and

\[
 \begin{aligned}
 \widetilde U_x^{\rm ext}H_{\rm patch}(g)
  \widetilde U_x^{{\rm ext}\dagger}
   &=H_{\rm patch}(T_xg),\\
 \widetilde U_t^{\rm ext}H_{\rm patch}(g)
  \widetilde U_t^{{\rm ext}\dagger}
   &=H_{\rm patch}(T_tFg),\qquad F(q,v)=(-q,v).
 \end{aligned}                                      \tag{4}
\]

Thus the `x`-lift moves geometry exactly, while the `t`-lift moves it onto
the shear-flipped field. Reflection-odd ADM parity is explicit frame data.

Two narrow walls also ship. `W1` is the canonical anchor-grade defect

\[
 \operatorname{rank}\bigl([N_{\rm patch},d_{\rm ext}]
                  -d_{\rm ext}\bigr)=12,             \tag{5}
\]

repaired exactly by `N_ext`. `W2` is the unflipped signed-`t` covariance
failure, whose residual has exact rank 28 on the witness, repaired exactly by
the shear flip in (4). These are boundaries with displayed repairs, not any
broader no-go.

## 2. Authority And Executed Contract

Current axiom authority is
[MINIMAL_AXIOMS_2026-06-29.md](MINIMAL_AXIOMS_2026-06-29.md) at
`origin/main 43ba5587944ffe0f43df10864c8348a99c17517b`, with axiom blob
`bc23300becfe4e4db57153c0e94cfcdf2338da71`.

The exact stacked parent is Block 105 commit
`d06066c2b908aaca0779625d831dfb10620cf34d`, content-bound through its note,
runner, and cache. Its note blob is
`5eff91757e38f3f2ea7dc2a2c50788636cc2e3a5`. No audit verdict is imported.
The content-bound ancestors are Block 104 commit
`7fe07db6c03fad1191893c942f708c5cb9a54c43` and Block 103 commit
`99cee0a6c962b382a3ca1a8497d589ffa280dfe8`.

The executed contract is:

1. the `d=2` invariant plane, the `Z4_t x Z4_x` fine torus, four `2 x 2`
   coarse cells, time-first ordering, and form basis
   `(1, dx, dt, dx∧dt)`;
2. temporal-gauge staggered phases `eta_t=1` and `eta_x=(-1)^t`;
3. the chi-relabeled fine carrier, with one Grassmann mode per fine site in
   the [Block 104](ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_WICK_PHASE_FINE_SITE_STAGGERED_OS_LORENTZ_BOUNDARY_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md)
   placement, and the momentum gate checked at all four coarse momenta;
4. the all-anchor patch carrier with fixed offset ordering
   `(00,01,10,11)`;
5. Block 105's exact rational shear/volume witness family and anchor
   assignment;
6. symbolic mass throughout; and
7. exact operator identities only. No OS, Ward-contraction, ADM, or gravity
   theorem for the patch carrier is claimed.

The construction, but not this execution, is dimension-generic: a `2^d`-fold
all-anchor cover gives `A^dagger A=I` in any `d`. Only `d=2` is executed here.
No `d=4` execution is claimed.

## 3. The Exact Real-Space Differential

Write `e_y` for the fine-site basis, with `y=(t,x)` on `Z4_t x Z4_x`, and
let

\[
 K={1\over2}\sum_{y,\mu}\eta_\mu(y)
 \left(|y\rangle\langle y+\widehat\mu|
      -|y+\widehat\mu\rangle\langle y|\right),
 \qquad \eta_t=1,\quad\eta_x=(-1)^t.             \tag{6}
\]

Give each site the exterior degree

\[
 \deg(t,x)=(t\bmod2)+(x\bmod2),\qquad
 N|t,x\rangle=\deg(t,x)|t,x\rangle.             \tag{7}
\]

Let `d_K` be the grade-raising part of `K`, and set `d=-i d_K`. Exact
real-space multiplication gives

\[
 K=d_K-d_K^T,\qquad d_K^2=0,\qquad [N,d]=d.       \tag{8}
\]

Consequently

\[
 D_{\rm stag}=mI+K=mI+i(d+d^\dagger)             \tag{9}
\]

as an identity. This is the same action by construction, not by
conjugation. Both `d_K` and `d` have exact fine-site range one.

There is an important distinction from Block 104. Its equation (27),

\[
 W(Q)^\dagger D_{\rm stag}(Q)W(Q)=Q_E(H_0;q),     \tag{10}
\]

is verified momentum-by-momentum as a gate at all four torus coarse momenta
`(Q_t,Q_x) in {0,pi}^2`; see
`docs/ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_WICK_PHASE_FINE_SITE_STAGGERED_OS_LORENTZ_BOUNDARY_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md:347-359`.
The carrier of this note is the chi relabeling itself, where (9) holds
identically with the displayed `d`. The momentum-placement phase is neither
needed for nor present in any real-space object here. This distinction is
load-bearing: it keeps every operator strictly local.

## 4. The All-Anchor Isometry And The Local Dual

For every anchor `n in Z4_t x Z4_x`, let
`E_n:C^4 -> C^16` embed the offsets `(00,01,10,11)` at the sites `n+A`.
The patch carrier and its unweighted analysis map are

\[
 \mathcal P=\bigoplus_{n\in\mathbb Z_4^2}\mathbb C^4\cong\mathbb C^{64},
 \qquad
 A={1\over2}\bigoplus_nE_n^\dagger:
 \mathbb C^{16}\longrightarrow\mathcal P.       \tag{11}
\]

Every site occurs in exactly four patches, so

\[
 A^\dagger A={1\over4}\sum_nE_nE_n^\dagger=I.   \tag{12}
\]

Therefore

\[
 L=A^\dagger,\qquad LA=I,                       \tag{13}
\]

and `L` is patch-local by inspection. This avoids the Block 105 boundary
that, for its pseudoinverse decoration, “for a generic nonuniform Gram its
inverse can be dense”; see
`docs/ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_SHIFTED_ORIGIN_FRAME_GAUGE_NONUNIFORM_HODGE_OVERLAP_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md:387-400`.
No Gram inverse is formed.

There is also an exact weighted corollary. For the positive block-diagonal
patch Hodge defined below, set

\[
 E_g=H_{\rm patch}^{1/2}A,
 \qquad L_g=A^\dagger H_{\rm patch}^{-1/2}.       \tag{14}
\]

Then

\[
 L_g E_g = I,
 \qquad E_g^\dagger E_g=A^\dagger H_{\rm patch}A
                         =H_{\rm ov}.            \tag{15}
\]

The second equality is the reading of Block 105 equation (27), whose Gram
statement is at
`docs/ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_SHIFTED_ORIGIN_FRAME_GAUGE_NONUNIFORM_HODGE_OVERLAP_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md:355-367`.
More generally, for any invertible block-diagonal `C`, the replacements

\[
 A_C=CA,\quad L_C=A^\dagger C^{-1},\quad
 d_C=Cd_{\rm ext}C^{-1},\quad N_C=CN_{\rm ext}C^{-1} \tag{16}
\]

transport every identity in Sections 5–7. The primary runner verifies the
exact rational conjugate `C=H_patch`; the `H_patch^(1/2)` statement follows
because conjugation by any invertible block-diagonal map preserves each
identity.

## 5. The Descended Complex

Define

\[
 d_{\rm ext}=AdA^\dagger,
 \qquad N_{\rm ext}=ANA^\dagger.                \tag{17}
\]

Using only `A^dagger A=I`, the five descent identities are

\[
 \begin{gathered}
 d_{\rm ext}^{\,2}=0,
 \qquad [N_{\rm ext},d_{\rm ext}]=d_{\rm ext},\\
 d_{\rm ext}A=Ad,
 \qquad Ld_{\rm ext}=dL,
 \qquad N_{\rm ext}A=AN.
 \end{gathered}                                  \tag{18}
\]

They give nilpotence, the exact exterior grading, intertwining in both
directions, and physical-range invariance. In particular, the range of `A`
is an invariant copy of the fine complex.

The construction is uniformly finite-range. A block
`(d_ext)_(n,m)=(1/4)E_n^dagger d E_m` can be nonzero only when a site
`n+A` of the `n` patch is a range-one neighbor of a site `m+B` of the `m`
patch, so `m-n = ±mu-hat + A - B` for offsets `A, B in {0,1}^2`: the hop
axis contributes at most two and the other axis at most one. Hence

\[
 (d_{\rm ext})_{n,m}=0
 \quad\hbox{if}\quad \operatorname{dist}_1(n,m)>3. \tag{19}
\]

Thus `d_ext` has exact anchor-block range three. It is built before any
geometry field is chosen and is therefore geometry-free.

The complement is equally explicit:

\[
 \mathbb C^{64}=\operatorname{range}(A)\oplus\ker(L),
 \qquad d_{\rm ext}|_{\ker(L)}=0.               \tag{20}
\]

The complex is exactly `(fine complex) + (zero complex)`. The zero summand
is the redundant off-range carrier, not a physical copy. The descent adds no
spurious cohomology.

## 6. Onsite Patch Geometry Is The Overlap Hodge

Write the exact rational shear/volume block as

\[
 H_{\rm site}(q,v)=
 \begin{pmatrix}
 v&0&0&0\\
 0&v^{-1}&-q/v&0\\
 0&-q/v&v^{-1}&0\\
 0&0&0&v^{-1}
 \end{pmatrix},                                 \tag{21}
\]

with the parent witness pairs

\[
 (q,v)=(0,1),(3/5,4/5),(5/13,12/13),(8/17,15/17),
 (7/25,24/25),(20/29,21/29),(12/37,35/37),(9/41,40/41) \tag{22}
\]

and assignment `q_(t,x)=Q_((3t+x) mod 8)`. These are the Block 105 blocks
and assignment at
`docs/ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_SHIFTED_ORIGIN_FRAME_GAUGE_NONUNIFORM_HODGE_OVERLAP_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md:242-260`
and
`docs/ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_SHIFTED_ORIGIN_FRAME_GAUGE_NONUNIFORM_HODGE_OVERLAP_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md:323-331`.

On the patch carrier define

\[
 H_{\rm patch}(g)=\bigoplus_n H_{\rm site}(g_n). \tag{23}
\]

It is anchor-onsite by construction. Its pullback is exactly

\[
 A^\dagger H_{\rm patch}(g)A
 ={1\over4}\sum_nE_nH_{\rm site}(g_n)E_n^\dagger
 =H_{\rm ov}[g].                                \tag{24}
\]

Block 105's `W1` found interblock support for `H_ov` in every parity cover.
That support, recorded at
`docs/ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_SHIFTED_ORIGIN_FRAME_GAUGE_NONUNIFORM_HODGE_OVERLAP_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md:355-367`,
is exactly the shadow of the onsite operator (23) under the four-fold cover.
The patch carrier is the surface on which nonuniform geometry is
simultaneously onsite, with no parity-cover choice remaining.

Positivity is inherited. Every patch block is positive, while Block 105
runner `F` gives `H_ov >= (3/7)I` and all sixteen positive leading principal
minors at
`docs/ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_SHIFTED_ORIGIN_FRAME_GAUGE_NONUNIFORM_HODGE_OVERLAP_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md:333-342`.
This is operator/Hodge positivity, not reflection positivity.

## 7. The Same-Action Pullback

For symbolic mass, put

\[
 Q_{\rm patch}(g,d_{\rm ext})
 =mH_{\rm patch}
  +i\left(H_{\rm patch}d_{\rm ext}
  +d_{\rm ext}^\dagger H_{\rm patch}\right).    \tag{25}
\]

The intertwining identities in (18) give

\[
 \begin{aligned}
 A^\dagger Q_{\rm patch}(g,d_{\rm ext})A
 &=mH_{\rm ov}
   +i\left(H_{\rm ov}d+d^\dagger H_{\rm ov}\right)\\
 &=Q_E(H_{\rm ov},d).
 \end{aligned}                                  \tag{26}
\]

This is the exact same-action pullback. The patch action with anchor-onsite
geometry induces exactly the overlap-Hodge action on the physical carrier.
The “same physical coupling” demand is met with zero contact terms at this
kinematic level.

Because (18) intertwines both degree and differential, (26) also reproduces
the same graded Ward operator action on `range(A)`. No Ward-contraction
theorem is claimed for the patch carrier.

In the flat case, `H_patch=I`, so

\[
 A^\dagger\left[mI+i(d_{\rm ext}+d_{\rm ext}^\dagger)\right]A
 =mI+i(d+d^\dagger)=D_{\rm stag}.               \tag{27}
\]

Thus the identity is the same fine action, not merely a spectral or
momentum-space equivalence.

## 8. Signed Shifts, Patch Lifts, And Shear Parity

Let `T_a e_y=e_(y+a)` on the fine carrier and define

\[
 \widetilde U_t=\operatorname{diag}((-1)^x)T_t,
 \qquad \widetilde U_x=T_x.                    \tag{28}
\]

Both commute with `D_stag`, and their exact projective algebra is

\[
 \widetilde U_t\widetilde U_x
   =-\widetilde U_x\widetilde U_t,
 \qquad
 \widetilde U_t^{\,2}=T_t^2,
 \qquad \widetilde U_x^{\,2}=T_x^2.            \tag{29}
\]

The squares are the plain two-step coarse translations, not `I`. This is the
torus form of the projective structure in Block 105 equation (2).

On the patch basis `e_(n,alpha)`, define the plain anchor permutations and
the sign field by

\[
 \widehat T_a e_{n,\alpha}=e_{n+a,\alpha},
 \qquad
 \Lambda_t e_{n,\alpha}=(-1)^{n_x+\alpha_x}e_{n,\alpha},
 \qquad \Lambda_x=I.                            \tag{30}
\]

The signed patch lifts are

\[
 \widetilde U_t^{\rm ext}=\Lambda_t\widehat T_t,
 \qquad
 \widetilde U_x^{\rm ext}=\widehat T_x,
 \qquad
 \widetilde U_a^{\rm ext}A=A\widetilde U_a.    \tag{31}
\]

They obey the same projective algebra as (29), preserve `range(A)` and
`ker(L)`, and leave the flat patch action in (27) invariant. Thus the signed
one-site shifts lift compatibly to the descended carrier.

For the active field translation convention
`(T_a g)_(n+a)=g_n`, the plain lifts obey exactly

\[
 \widehat T_aH_{\rm patch}(g)\widehat T_a^\dagger
 =H_{\rm patch}(T_ag).                          \tag{32}
\]

The signed `x`-lift is the plain lift and obeys the same identity. In the
`t` direction, the offset part of `Lambda_t` is
`J=diag(1,-1,1,-1)`, and direct block multiplication gives

\[
 JH_{\rm site}(q,v)J=H_{\rm site}(-q,v).        \tag{33}
\]

Therefore, exactly,

\[
 \widetilde U_t^{\rm ext}H_{\rm patch}(g)
 \widetilde U_t^{{\rm ext}\dagger}
 =H_{\rm patch}(T_tFg),
 \qquad (Fg)_n=(-q_n,v_n).                     \tag{34}
\]

The connection field

\[
 \Lambda_a=\widetilde U_a^{\rm ext}\widehat T_a^\dagger \tag{35}
\]

is an explicit diagonal `+/-1` field. If the shear flip is omitted, the
residual

\[
 \widetilde U_t^{\rm ext}H_{\rm patch}(g)
 \widetilde U_t^{{\rm ext}\dagger}
 -H_{\rm patch}(T_tg)                           \tag{36}
\]

has exact rank 28 on the displayed rational witness. The decomposition is
visible in (21) and (33): per anchor, `J H_site(q,v) J - H_site(q,v)` has
exactly the two `∓2q/v` shear entries, an exact rank-two block whenever
`q != 0`, and the displayed assignment leaves exactly two flat anchors
(`(3t+x) mod 8 = 0` at `(0,0)` and `(2,2)`), so `28 = 14 x 2`. Equation (34)
repairs it exactly and positively.

This is the patch-carrier return of Block 105's reflection identity
`P_t H(a,b,c) P_t=H(a,b,-c)` and its conclusion that ADM shear is reflection
odd; see
`docs/ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_SHIFTED_ORIGIN_FRAME_GAUGE_NONUNIFORM_HODGE_OVERLAP_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md:435-444`.
The `t`-direction transporter must carry the shear flip. This is exactly the
seam structure needed by the ADM/history gate, but the action-derived seam
link itself remains a downstream task.

## 9. The Canonical-Grade Boundary

Let

\[
 N_{\rm patch}=\bigoplus_nN_0,
 \qquad N_0=\operatorname{diag}(0,1,1,2).        \tag{37}
\]

The canonical anchor grade has the exact defect already displayed in (5):

\[
 \operatorname{rank}\bigl([N_{\rm patch},d_{\rm ext}]
                  -d_{\rm ext}\bigr)=12.        \tag{38}
\]

The descended grade closes the defect exactly:

\[
 [N_{\rm ext},d_{\rm ext}]-d_{\rm ext}=0.       \tag{39}
\]

No grade-preserving anchor-local similarity can remove the rank. For every
invertible such `C`, conjugation gives

\[
 [CN_{\rm patch}C^{-1},Cd_{\rm ext}C^{-1}]
   -Cd_{\rm ext}C^{-1}
 =C\bigl([N_{\rm patch},d_{\rm ext}]-d_{\rm ext}\bigr)C^{-1}, \tag{40}
\]

so the rank is invariant.

Block 105 already proved that a transitive one-site action cannot preserve
the fixed nonconstant census `(0,1,1,2)` and that the degree must
co-transform; see
`docs/ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_SHIFTED_ORIGIN_FRAME_GAUGE_NONUNIFORM_HODGE_OVERLAP_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md:222-227`.
On the patch carrier the co-transforming degree is `N_ext`. Its exact gap
from the canonical census is candidate discrete-connection data for a later
construction.

## 10. No-Go Discipline Gate

There are exactly two narrow finite-witness statements:

- `W1`: the canonical anchor-local grade `N_patch` is not a grade operator
  for `d_ext`; its defect has exact rank 12 on the displayed carrier, and
  `N_ext` closes it exactly; and
- `W2`: the signed `t`-lift does not move the displayed nonzero-shear anchor
  field to its unflipped translate; its residual has exact rank 28, and the
  shear-flipped identity (34) closes it exactly and positively.

`W1` is not a descent, carrier, grading, or gravity no-go. `W2` is not a
translation, geometry, or covariance no-go. The retained Lattice authority
licenses only the translation/no-privileged-site target:
[Lattice, lines 35–41](MINIMAL_AXIOMS_2026-06-29.md#lattice--physical-locality).
It does **not** prove the new ranks. Those are current-cycle evidence in
primary-runner checks `C`, `D`, `F`, `G`, `H`, and `I`.

The physical Hodge, one-fine-mode carrier, and overlap construction are
content-bound unaudited dependencies, not imported retained grades. The
exact parent pin is Block 105 commit
`d06066c2b908aaca0779625d831dfb10620cf34d`, note blob
`5eff91757e38f3f2ea7dc2a2c50788636cc2e3a5`. Its ancestors are Block 104
commit `7fe07db6c03fad1191893c942f708c5cb9a54c43` and Block 103 commit
`99cee0a6c962b382a3ca1a8497d589ffa280dfe8`. No dependency supplies an
imported audit verdict.

### N1 — Alternative Route Enumeration

Routes are normalized by `(primary object/formulation, mechanism/invariant,
terminal obligation)`. Every row is an attempted attack on the stated wall.
A positive repair or premise-narrowing route is marked honestly and is not
counted as an in-premise counterexample.

#### W1 attacks

| normalized family | honesty marker | attempted route | why it does not overturn `W1` |
|---|---|---|---|
| canonical census / direct commutator / grade terminal | **ATTEMPTED** | Test `N_patch=diag_n N_0` directly against the descended differential. | Current runner `I` gives the exact rank-12 defect (38). The inherited canonical-frame issue is content-bound at [Block 105](ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_SHIFTED_ORIGIN_FRAME_GAUGE_NONUNIFORM_HODGE_OVERLAP_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md), `docs/ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_SHIFTED_ORIGIN_FRAME_GAUGE_NONUNIFORM_HODGE_OVERLAP_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md:369-385`; the new rank is current evidence. |
| descended grade / isometric transport / exact grading terminal | **ATTEMPTED — positive repair** | Use `N_ext=A N A^dagger` instead of resetting the census in every patch. | Current runner `D` gives (18) and (39) exactly, executing the transition-compatible target at `docs/ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_SHIFTED_ORIGIN_FRAME_GAUGE_NONUNIFORM_HODGE_OVERLAP_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md:387-400`; the repair is the transported grade, not the canonical census asserted in `W1`. |
| Reynolds grade / trivial-character average / nontrivial census terminal | **ATTEMPTED** | Average the four canonical frame grades and use the invariant as `N_patch`. | Content-bound Block 105 runner `G` gives average grade `I` at `docs/ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_SHIFTED_ORIGIN_FRAME_GAUGE_NONUNIFORM_HODGE_OVERLAP_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md:369-385`; it erases rather than restores the canonical exterior census. |
| character-projected differential / nontrivial Fourier sector / nilpotent terminal | **ATTEMPTED** | Pair a nontrivial `Z2^2` character sector with a character-adapted census. | Content-bound Block 105 runner `G`, at the same `docs/ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_SHIFTED_ORIGIN_FRAME_GAUGE_NONUNIFORM_HODGE_OVERLAP_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md:369-385`, gives ranks `(4,4,0)`; the only nilpotent component is zero. |
| anchor-local similarity / conjugation invariant / zero-defect terminal | **ATTEMPTED** | Apply a grade-preserving invertible similarity independently on anchor blocks. | Equation (40), checked by current runners `G/I`, conjugates the entire defect, so rank 12 is invariant. The reason a nonconstant fixed census needs correction is content-bound at `docs/ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_SHIFTED_ORIGIN_FRAME_GAUGE_NONUNIFORM_HODGE_OVERLAP_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md:222-227`. |
| constant-per-offset census / shift commutant / canonical terminal | **ATTEMPTED** | Re-derive a diagonal grade that is constant for each offset and invariant under both one-site shifts. | Content-bound Block 105 runner `C` gives a constraint rank of three on four entries at `docs/ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_SHIFTED_ORIGIN_FRAME_GAUGE_NONUNIFORM_HODGE_OVERLAP_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md:222-227`; only a scalar survives the transitive shift action. |

#### W2 attacks

| normalized family | honesty marker | attempted route | why it does not overturn `W2` |
|---|---|---|---|
| plain permutation / matter lift / simultaneous covariance terminal | **ATTEMPTED** | Use `T_hat_t` without the staggered sign, since it moves the geometry field by (32). | Current runner `H` verifies geometry covariance, but the plain lift is not a symmetry of the descended flat matter action: the sign field is load-bearing. The projective signed matter input is content-bound at `docs/ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_SHIFTED_ORIGIN_FRAME_GAUGE_NONUNIFORM_HODGE_OVERLAP_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md:38-60`. |
| signed lift / unflipped field / zero-residual terminal | **ATTEMPTED** | Demand covariance with `H_patch(T_t g)` while keeping every shear sign fixed. | Current runner `H` gives exact residual rank 28 in (36). The underlying generic-shear blocks are the content-bound matrices at `docs/ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_SHIFTED_ORIGIN_FRAME_GAUGE_NONUNIFORM_HODGE_OVERLAP_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md:242-260`. |
| shear-flipped field / reflection transition / covariance terminal | **ATTEMPTED — positive repair** | Transport to `T_t Fg`, with `F(q,v)=(-q,v)`. | Current runner `H` verifies (33)–(34) exactly. This repairs covariance by changing the target field in precisely the way independently required by the parent reflection identity at `docs/ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_SHIFTED_ORIGIN_FRAME_GAUGE_NONUNIFORM_HODGE_OVERLAP_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md:435-444`; it does not make the unflipped claim true. |
| diagonal sign redefinition / Hodge commutant / unflipped terminal | **ATTEMPTED** | Redefine the admissible lift signs while keeping the generic patch Hodge fixed. | Among admissible lift-sign changes, only per-patch scalars `R=diag_n(r_n I_4)` commute with `H_patch`; then `(R Lambda_t)H(R Lambda_t)^dagger=Lambda_t H Lambda_t^dagger`, so the relative `dx`-offset sign survives. Current runner `H` checks this against the blocks at `docs/ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_SHIFTED_ORIGIN_FRAME_GAUGE_NONUNIFORM_HODGE_OVERLAP_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md:242-260`. |
| zero-shear restriction / invariant subfamily / unflipped terminal | **ATTEMPTED — narrowing** | Restrict to fields for which `Fg=g`. | Current runner `H` gives `Fg=g` iff every `q_n=0`, so `W2` is empty on the shear-free subfamily. This matches Block 105's diagonal parity-mode survivor, which explicitly has no shear, at `docs/ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_SHIFTED_ORIGIN_FRAME_GAUGE_NONUNIFORM_HODGE_OVERLAP_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md:278-287`; it does not overturn the nonzero-shear witness. |
| reflection parity / ADM reading / same-sign terminal | **ATTEMPTED** | Read the relative sign as a removable translation convention instead of reflection data. | Block 105 equation (32), at `docs/ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_SHIFTED_ORIGIN_FRAME_GAUGE_NONUNIFORM_HODGE_OVERLAP_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md:435-444`, gives the exact same residual: `P_t H(c) P_t=H(-c)`. Current runner `H` realizes it patchwise, so a same-sign target is the wrong field. |

### N2 — Wall-Independence Audit

| pair | closing first automatically closes second? | closing second automatically closes first? | independent? | exact reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `(W1,W2)` | no | no | yes | Choosing `N_ext` leaves the rank-28 unflipped geometry residual unchanged; adopting the shear-flip transporter leaves the rank-12 canonical-grade defect unchanged. |

There is no inflated third wall. The collapsed set is exactly `{W1,W2}`.

### N3 — Hidden-Wall Scan

The required phrase scan found no hidden condition promoted to a third wall.
Every occurrence or close variant is classified below.

| hit/variant | classification | explicit meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `canonical` | displayed census convention | `N_patch=diag_n N_0`; no uniqueness or authority is imported |
| `by construction` | displayed identity or definition | equation (9) is an operator equality, and (23) explicitly defines anchor-onsite support |
| `local` | exact support statement | fine range one, patch-local dual, and anchor-block range three |
| `gauge` | supplied transition convention | no dynamical gauge field or gravity equation is imported |
| `same action` | exact pullback identity | equation (26), not a spectral analogy or a Ward-contraction theorem |
| `one mode` | physical carrier count | one fine Grassmann mode per site; anchor components are redundant |
| `positive` | narrowed Hodge statement | positive patch/overlap operators, not OS or history positivity |
| `ADM` | downstream interface | only reflection-odd shear parity is executed; the temporal link is open |
| `gravity` | explicit exclusion | no joint measure, dynamics, constraint quotient, or recoil theorem |
| `axiom` | accounting firewall | the approved Lattice target is cited; no amendment is inferred |
| `retained` | audit-status firewall | no audit grade is imported and no retained-science status is assigned |
| `TOE` | portfolio firewall | no obligation or percentage movement follows from these identities |

No occurrence supplies a hidden premise.

### N4 — Residual Matching

| cited witness (exact path and line) | witness residual | current residual | match? | disposition |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [Block 105 Section 8](ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_SHIFTED_ORIGIN_FRAME_GAUGE_NONUNIFORM_HODGE_OVERLAP_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md), `docs/ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_SHIFTED_ORIGIN_FRAME_GAUGE_NONUNIFORM_HODGE_OVERLAP_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md:387-400` | uniformly bounded local dual, nilpotent descent, invariant range, signed shifts, and action pullback were the exact target | equations (12), (18), (19), (26), and (31) execute that target | yes | exact next-interface match |
| [Block 105 N7](ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_SHIFTED_ORIGIN_FRAME_GAUGE_NONUNIFORM_HODGE_OVERLAP_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md), `docs/ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_SHIFTED_ORIGIN_FRAME_GAUGE_NONUNIFORM_HODGE_OVERLAP_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md:585-591` | `L_g E_g=I`, uniform finite range, signed-shift covariance, exact `Q_E` pullback | equations (15), (19), (26), and (31) execute every terminal obligation | yes | exact steelman match |
| [Block 105 Section 12](ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_SHIFTED_ORIGIN_FRAME_GAUGE_NONUNIFORM_HODGE_OVERLAP_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md), `docs/ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_SHIFTED_ORIGIN_FRAME_GAUGE_NONUNIFORM_HODGE_OVERLAP_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md:630-638` | item 1 requested the common nilpotent patch/frame differential; items 2–4 left ADM, the Gram, and gravity quotient downstream | item 1 is executed; items 2–4 remain open | yes | exact match and next interface |
| [Block 104 Section 10](ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_WICK_PHASE_FINE_SITE_STAGGERED_OS_LORENTZ_BOUNDARY_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md), `docs/ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_WICK_PHASE_FINE_SITE_STAGGERED_OS_LORENTZ_BOUNDARY_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md:593-605` | shifted-block covariance was first priority and the ADM transporter followed it | Block 105 executed shifted-block covariance; this note executes origin-free descent, while ADM transport remains open | yes | exact priority match |

No nonmatching citation is used.

### N5 — Rhetoric And Granularity Audit

The strongest permitted sentence is: “The all-anchor patch carrier admits an
exact patch-local dual and nilpotent graded descent whose pullback is the
overlap-Hodge action; the canonical anchor census and the unflipped
t-covariance are exact narrow boundaries with displayed repairs.”

Forbidden upgrades include “the Dirac-Kahler gravity carrier is complete,”
“OS positivity holds on the patch carrier,” “the ADM link is derived,” “a TOE
obligation is retired,” and “the frame connection is constructed.”

```text
per_element: exact dual, descent, grading, pullback, lift, and shear-parity identities are checked symbolically in the mass
per_site: every fine site lies in exactly four patches and keeps one physical Grassmann mode; no anchor copy is added
per_mode: the blocked staggered symbol matches Block 104 momentum-by-momentum, including both zero and pi coarse lines
per_block: d_ext has anchor-block range three, H_patch is exactly anchor-onsite, and the signed/plain lift mismatch is a displayed sign field
lattice_wide: checked and not executed — the ADM/history transporter, reflection positivity/OS on the patch carrier, joint gravity, the gravity constraint quotient, Records, selection, audit retention, and TOE closure remain open
```

The primary runner prints these five lines verbatim, so the N5 certificate
lands in cached stdout as well as in this note.

### N6 — Partial-Closure Path Scan

| candidate path | status/source | what it closes without a new axiom | remaining terminal |
|---|---|---|---|
| no-privileged-site reframe | approved foundation, [Lattice lines 35–41](MINIMAL_AXIOMS_2026-06-29.md#lattice--physical-locality) | makes the all-anchor carrier origin-free and treats patch labels as representation data | derive the physical temporal link |
| registered foundation node | approved `minimal_axioms` registry line, provenance path `docs/audit/data/axiom_premise_nodes.json`, as content-bound in [Block 105](ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_SHIFTED_ORIGIN_FRAME_GAUGE_NONUNIFORM_HODGE_OVERLAP_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md), `docs/ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_SHIFTED_ORIGIN_FRAME_GAUGE_NONUNIFORM_HODGE_OVERLAP_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md:563-576` | chain-satisfies the translation premise without assigning this note an audit grade | supplies no action, history measure, or dynamics |
| all-anchor descent | current runner `C/D/F` | closes the exact local dual, invariant range, nilpotent grade, and same-action pullback | ADM/history action and Gram |
| shear-flip transporter reading | current runner `H` | closes the exact kinematic geometry transition and identifies its diagonal sign field | derive that transition from the ADM/history action |
| local connection correction of the canonical census | live downstream target | could close the rank-12 canonical-grade gap if the ADM route requires that census | construct and test the local `Z2^d` connection |

The registry scan found no approved primitive that needs adding or amending.
Frame gauge and patch weights are conventions. The descent and temporal-link
choices are downstream action constructions. No axiom amendment is
justified.

### N7 — Steelman

**Hostile steelman against the walls.** `W1` may be an artifact of this one
descent choice: a cleverer local isometry might be compatible with the
canonical grade. Likewise, the `W2` shear flip may be removable by a different
choice of patch signs. A finite witness for this carrier cannot establish a
broad grading or covariance obstruction.

That attack is correct against every broad no-go, but not against the shipped
walls. The transitive-shift census obstruction in content-bound Block 105
runner `C`, at
`docs/ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_SHIFTED_ORIGIN_FRAME_GAUGE_NONUNIFORM_HODGE_OVERLAP_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md:222-227`,
applies to every one-mode-per-site transported diagonal grade. The concrete
remaining mechanism is a genuine local `Z2^d` connection correcting the
census, which is the named next-cycle target. Independently, the flip survives
every `H_patch`-commuting admissible sign redefinition and matches the
reflection parity derived in
`docs/ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_SHIFTED_ORIGIN_FRAME_GAUGE_NONUNIFORM_HODGE_OVERLAP_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md:435-444`.
It is structure, not convention. The steelman defeats any broad
grading/covariance no-go. That is why only the finite `W1/W2` statements ship.

### N8 — Cross-Cycle Echo

| earlier wall (exact source) | repair here | discipline applied |
|---|---|---|
| Block 105 descent boundary, `docs/ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_SHIFTED_ORIGIN_FRAME_GAUGE_NONUNIFORM_HODGE_OVERLAP_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md:387-400` | the tight all-anchor cover supplies `L=A^dagger`, exactly the bounded-local-dual mechanism its N7 steelman named at `docs/ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_SHIFTED_ORIGIN_FRAME_GAUGE_NONUNIFORM_HODGE_OVERLAP_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md:585-591` | seek the named finite repair before widening a descent wall |
| Block 105 `W1` onsite boundary, `docs/ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_SHIFTED_ORIGIN_FRAME_GAUGE_NONUNIFORM_HODGE_OVERLAP_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md:278-287` | the same overlap Hodge is exactly onsite on the redundant patch carrier | distinguish onsite-on-patch support from onsite in every disjoint cover |
| Block 104 blocking-origin risk, `docs/ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_WICK_PHASE_FINE_SITE_STAGGERED_OS_LORENTZ_BOUNDARY_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md:361-364` | Block 105 supplied shifted-block covariance and the present all-anchor carrier removes the origin choice | preserve the one-mode carrier while adding redundant analysis data |

The common discipline is to ship narrow walls with named repairs and never
promote a failed averaging route to a universal no-go.

**No-Go Discipline verdict:** **PASS** only for finite-witness `W1` and `W2`
inside their fixed premises. **FAIL** for descent, grading, covariance,
Dirac-Kahler matter, gravity, axiom necessity, or TOE no-go.

## 11. Axiom And TOE Disposition

No axiom amendment is justified. The Lattice no-privileged-site target is
served by the origin-free all-anchor carrier; nothing new is assumed. Frame
gauge and tight-cover weights remain conventions rather than ontology.

This is real route progress because the named Block 105 lemma is executed.
It is not retained science and retires no end-to-end obligation. TOE
accounting remains:

- zero obligation retirement;
- no TOE percentage moves; and
- retained-positive end-to-end theory count remains zero.

## 12. Next Decision

The shortest high-value sequence is:

1. derive the reflection-odd ADM temporal link and seam overlap from
   `Q_E(H_patch)` on the descended patch carrier, using the exact shear-flip
   transporter of Section 8 rather than prescribing it;
2. test the unnormalized two-history Gram on both spatial eigenlines;
3. attempt the local `Z2^d` connection closing the canonical-census gap in
   Section 9 if the ADM route needs the canonical grade; and
4. only then couple the physical gravity constraint quotient and ask whether
   a retained obligation can move.

The actual ADM/history transporter remains unexecuted.
Reflection positivity remains unexecuted.
The gravity constraint quotient remains unexecuted.
