## 1. Result Up Front

[Block 126](ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_TIME_DRESSING_ADJOINTNESS_WALL_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-17.md)
closed onto the following handoff next gate, anchored byte-exactly at

and elaborated in its Next Decision:

**THE NATURALITY-MODULI THEOREM.** Fix either rational shear fixture
$s\in\{5/13,3/5\}$. Let $B_s=\operatorname{span}\{x_s,y_s\}$ be the
certified boundary-data span and let $C_s=B_s^\perp$ be its displayed
orthocomplement. For an admissible nonzero normalization $\mu$, define the
$\mu$-swap on $B_s$ by

\[
 S_{\mu,s}x_s=\mu y_s,
 \qquad
 S_{\mu,s}y_s=\mu^{-1}x_s,
 \qquad
 S_{\mu,s}^2=I_{B_s}.                           \tag{1}
\]

Let $\mathfrak M_s(\mu)$ denote the reflection-reality-covariant
involutive intertwiners which complete the inherited half-space pairing and
whose boundary restriction is (1). The exact classification is

\[
 \mathfrak M_s(\mu)
 \cong
 \mathscr A_s\times
 \coprod_{r=0}^{4}\mathscr I_{s,r}.             \tag{2}
\]

Here $\mathscr A_s$ is the certified space of reality-compatible extension
constants,

\[
 \dim_{\mathbb R}\mathscr A_s=8,                \tag{3}
\]

and $\mathscr I_{s,r}$ is the stratum of reality-compatible involutions
$J_s$ on $C_s$ whose $+1$ eigenspace has dimension $r$. Equivalently, each
completion is the $\mu$-swap on the boundary-data span plus an arbitrary
reality-compatible involution on the orthocomplement, with the compatible
constant recording the extension between those displayed pieces.

The complement stratum has exact real dimension

\[
 \dim_{\mathbb R}\mathscr I_{s,r}=2r(4-r),
 \qquad r=0,1,2,3,4.                            \tag{4}
\]

Consequently the fixed-$\mu$ completion stratum obeys

\[
 \boxed{
 \dim_{\mathbb R}\mathfrak M_{s,r}(\mu)
 =8+2r(4-r)}.                                  \tag{5}
\]

The displayed swap completion is one point of (2). With
$J_s^{\mathrm{sw}}$ denoting its inherited complement involution, that
point is

\[
 \Theta_s^{\mathrm{sw}}
 =\Theta_s(1,0,J_s^{\mathrm{sw}}).              \tag{6}
\]

It is not the whole moduli space.

Four displayed naturality criteria have distinct outcomes:

| displayed criterion | exact outcome | selection power |
|---|---|---|
| physical inversion $\Theta M\Theta=M^{-1}$ | holds exactly at the swap and on a positive-dimensional family | does not isolate the swap |
| commutation $[\Theta,M]=0$ | excluded for every moduli member | selects no completion |
| spectral-projector expressibility in $M$ | excluded for every moduli member | selects no completion |
| minimality | leaves a $\mu$-family unless $\mu=1$ is imposed | selects the swap only after normalization |

The inversion identity at the swap is exact, not a residual-norm claim.
It is nevertheless nonselective: the same identity has a
positive-dimensional solution locus inside (2). Thus physical inversion
does not pin the swap.

The two negative criteria fail by one common eigenline argument. The stable
direction $x_s$ is an $M_s$-eigenline, while every completion must send it
to the boundary partner $y_s$ up to the nonzero $\mu$ normalization. The
vector $y_s$ straddles the displayed grading and is not the proportional
stable eigenvector which commutation would require. Hence no completion in
(2) commutes with $M_s$. Any expression assembled only from the spectral
projectors of $M_s$ commutes with $M_s$, so spectral-projector
expressibility is excluded as well.

Minimality gives the only displayed positive selection statement, and it
has an indispensable qualifier. The inherited minimal-extension condition
removes the extension constant and the extra complement freedom, but it
leaves the boundary normalization:

\[
 \operatorname{Min}(\mathfrak M_s)
 =\{\Theta_s(\mu,0,J_s^{\mathrm{sw}}):
     \mu\text{ admissible and nonzero}\}.       \tag{7}
\]

Adding $\mu=1$ reduces (7) to the single point (6). Without that
normalization, minimality returns a $\mu$-family rather than a unique
completion.

The honest verdict is therefore **canonical-as-minimal-normalized**. The
swap is data-derived, is the unique minimal member after the displayed
$\mu=1$ normalization, and satisfies physical inversion exactly. It is not
criterion-unique without those qualifiers. No displayed criterion selects
it unconditionally.

That moduli freedom is a live resource, not a defect declaration. Write

\[
 O_s^\star:=\widehat O_{\downarrow,s}            \tag{8}
\]

for Block 126's nonzero descending member. Whether some
$\Theta\in\mathfrak M_s(\mu)$ induces an adjointness operation admitting
$O_s^\star$ is the **moduli-adjointness hinge**. This theorem exposes the
space on which that question must be asked; it does not answer the hinge.

The hinge, the curved-carrier dependency, the cross-lane facet-charge
bridge, the completed ADM/history transporter, joint gravity, the gravity
constraint quotient beyond the displayed carrier, Records, audit
retention, axiom amendment, obligation retirement, and TOE percentage
movement remain outside this theorem.

## 2. Authority And Executed Contract

Current axiom authority is
[MINIMAL_AXIOMS_2026-06-29.md](MINIMAL_AXIOMS_2026-06-29.md) at the authority
snapshot inherited by Block 126:
`origin/main 4e566b14a6352a9a62590252a9755c7a103c1b9e`, with axiom blob
`bc23300becfe4e4db57153c0e94cfcdf2338da71` and registry blob
`b93959cca4f7e26c673cdccbe601e50c3cb93daa`. No newer authority claim is
made here.

The exact stacked parent is
[Block 126](ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_TIME_DRESSING_ADJOINTNESS_WALL_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-17.md)
commit `a145a4e2cfc19bc919371196d7c5f3451c0bb45d1`, content-bound through
note blob `86e55661f7bdc54540558491dcdd20123bcb89d`. Its inherited
boundary-data span, swap completion, reflection reality, and half-space
pairing come from
[Block 119](ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_REFLECTION_INTERTWINER_COMPLETION_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-16.md).
No audit verdict is imported from either note.

The executed contract is:

1. the certified half-space package at both rational shear fixtures
   $s=5/13$ and $s=3/5$, including its inherited boundary-data span,
   orthocomplement, reflection reality, pairing, monodromy, and swap point;
2. all reflection-reality-covariant involutive intertwiners in the displayed
   completion class, with their boundary restriction fixed to the
   $\mu$-swap (1);
3. the exact parametrization (2) by the eight-real-dimensional compatible
   constant and an arbitrary reality-compatible complement involution;
4. the fixed-$\mu$ stratification by the $+1$-eigenspace dimension
   $r\in\{0,1,2,3,4\}$ and the exact dimension law (5);
5. placement of the swap completion as the one point (6), without upgrading
   that point to the whole space;
6. the exact physical inversion solve, including the swap and a
   positive-dimensional family of further solutions;
7. the eigenline exclusion of monodromy commutation and, by implication,
   spectral-projector expressibility for every member of the displayed
   moduli;
8. the minimality solve, which is a $\mu$-family before normalization and
   the unique swap after the additional $\mu=1$ condition;
9. the narrow naturality verdict canonical-as-minimal-normalized and the
   explicit rejection of unconditional criterion uniqueness; and
10. one narrow wall W1, with the moduli-adjointness hinge, additional
    naturality criteria, curved dependence, and the cross-lane bridge left
    live.

The assigned primary runner is the path recorded in the front matter. This
note does not invent a replay footer or a `TOTAL` line: under the supplied
note-only contract, its scientific content is the supervisor-verified
certificate stated above. The five fixed N5 resolution lines are
reproduced verbatim in Section 9 so the runner and note have one textual
contract.

The scope is the displayed completion class, its certified boundary and
orthocomplement split, the two rational shear fixtures, the fixed-$\mu$
strata, and the four displayed selection criteria. No result on the
descending-member hinge, Ward compatibility, locality, a curved carrier,
the facet-charge bridge, history transport, joint gravity, or a gravity
quotient beyond the displayed carrier follows.

## 3. The Moduli Parametrization

Fix a fixture $s$ and write the certified carrier split as

\[
 H_s=B_s\oplus C_s,
 \qquad
 B_s=\operatorname{span}\{x_s,y_s\},
 \qquad
 C_s=B_s^\perp.                                \tag{9}
\]

The symbols in (9) are inherited data. The choice of orthocomplement is the
one in the certified package; this note does not classify arbitrary carrier
splittings.

Let $\mathfrak M_s$ be the set of intertwiners $\Theta$ satisfying all three
baseline conditions:

1. $\Theta$ completes the inherited half-space pairing with the required
   reflection and reality covariance;
2. $\Theta$ is involutive, $\Theta^2=I$; and
3. $\Theta$ has the inherited boundary intertwining action.

These are admissibility conditions, not naturality selectors. They define
the moduli problem before inversion, commutation, spectral expressibility,
or minimality is imposed.

On $B_s$, involutivity and the boundary intertwining action give exactly
the $\mu$-swap

\[
 \Theta x_s=\mu y_s,
 \qquad
 \Theta y_s=\mu^{-1}x_s.                       \tag{10}
\]

The admissible nonzero scalar $\mu$ records the normalization of the two
boundary directions. Equation (10) makes no preference for $\mu=1$.

After (10), the remaining certified data split into:

- a reality-compatible extension constant $A_s\in\mathscr A_s$; and
- a reality-compatible involution $J_s$ on $C_s$.

The exact reduction gives a bijection

\[
 \Theta
 \longleftrightarrow
 (\mu,A_s,J_s),
 \qquad
 A_s\in\mathscr A_s,
 \qquad
 J_s^2=I_{C_s}.                                \tag{11}
\]

Conversely, every certified triple on the right of (11) reconstructs a
reflection-reality-covariant involutive intertwiner completing the
half-space pairing. There are no omitted polynomial constraints inside the
displayed class. Thus (11) is a classification, not only a construction of
examples.

For fixed $\mu$, decompose by the complement signature

\[
 C_s=C_{s,+}(J_s)\oplus C_{s,-}(J_s),
 \qquad
 r:=\dim C_{s,+}(J_s),
 \qquad 0\le r\le4.                            \tag{12}
\]

Then

\[
 \mathfrak M_s(\mu)
 =\coprod_{r=0}^{4}\mathfrak M_{s,r}(\mu),
 \qquad
 \mathfrak M_{s,r}(\mu)
 \cong\mathscr A_s\times\mathscr I_{s,r}.      \tag{13}
\]

The swap completion supplied by Block 119 is the specific triple

\[
 (\mu,A_s,J_s)=(1,0,J_s^{\mathrm{sw}}).         \tag{14}
\]

It is a distinguished point once the normalization and minimal complement
data are named. Neither (11) nor admissibility alone declares it the unique
point.

The classification is fixturewise. The same form and dimensions hold at
$s=5/13$ and $s=3/5$; no continuous interpolation in the shear parameter
and no curved-family bundle are claimed.

## 4. The Dimension Law

The dimension in (5) has two independent structural summands. First, the
certified reality-compatible extension constant obeys

\[
 \dim_{\mathbb R}\mathscr A_s=8.               \tag{15}
\]

This is the constant term in every fixed-$\mu$ stratum. It is not a fitted
offset and it does not count the normalization scalar $\mu$.

Second, the certified reality condition gives a four-dimensional real form
$C_s^{\mathbb R}$ of the complement. Fixing $r$ identifies an involution
with an ordered complementary pair of its real eigenspaces. Its stratum is
the homogeneous space

\[
 \mathscr I_{s,r}
 \cong
 \frac{\operatorname{GL}(4,\mathbb R)}
 {\operatorname{GL}(r,\mathbb R)\times
  \operatorname{GL}(4-r,\mathbb R)}.            \tag{16}
\]

The real dimension is therefore

\[
 \dim_{\mathbb R}\mathscr I_{s,r}
 =16-r^2-(4-r)^2
 =2r(4-r).                                      \tag{17}
\]

Adding (15) and (17) in the product (13) yields

\[
 \dim_{\mathbb R}\mathfrak M_{s,r}(\mu)
 =8+2r(4-r).                                    \tag{18}
\]

The five exact stratum dimensions are:

| $r$ | complement contribution $2r(4-r)$ | fixed-$\mu$ total |
|---:|---:|---:|
| 0 | 0 | 8 |
| 1 | 6 | 14 |
| 2 | 8 | 16 |
| 3 | 6 | 14 |
| 4 | 0 | 8 |

Thus every fixed-$\mu$ stratum is positive-dimensional. The largest is the
balanced $r=2$ stratum of real dimension sixteen. The symmetry under
$r\leftrightarrow4-r$ exchanges the two complement eigenspaces; it does
not identify their points or erase the eight-dimensional extension data.

Equation (18) does not add a dimension for varying $\mu$. The theorem's
dimension law is explicitly fixed-$\mu$. When minimality later leaves a
$\mu$-family, that is a separate normalization freedom, not a correction to
(18).

Nor does the dimension law say that every moduli direction is physical.
It classifies admissible completions before the Block 129
moduli-adjointness hinge or any additional Ward, locality, or curved-carrier
condition is imposed.

## 5. The Inversion Criterion

Let $M_s$ denote the displayed companion-space monodromy lift inherited by
the certified package. The physical inversion condition is

\[
 \Theta M_s\Theta=M_s^{-1}.                    \tag{19}
\]

Because every $\Theta\in\mathfrak M_s$ is involutive, (19) is equivalently
the intertwining equation

\[
 \Theta M_s=M_s^{-1}\Theta.                   \tag{20}
\]

Define its solution locus inside the completion moduli by

\[
 \mathfrak P_s
 :=\{\Theta\in\mathfrak M_s:
       \Theta M_s\Theta=M_s^{-1}\}.            \tag{21}
\]

The exact substitution of the swap point gives

\[
 \Theta_s^{\mathrm{sw}}M_s
 \Theta_s^{\mathrm{sw}}=M_s^{-1}.              \tag{22}
\]

Equation (22) is an exact identity on the displayed companion space. It is
not inferred from a small floating residual, and it is not merely an
identity after quotient compression.

However, solving (19) over the parametrization (11) does not return the
single point (14). The exact solution locus satisfies

\[
 \Theta_s^{\mathrm{sw}}\in\mathfrak P_s,
 \qquad
 \dim_{\mathbb R}\mathfrak P_s>0              \tag{23}
\]

at each rational shear fixture. Thus a positive-dimensional family of
reflection-reality-covariant involutive completions obeys physical
inversion. The swap is one exact member of that family.

The selection consequence is immediate:

\[
 \boxed{
 \Theta M_s\Theta=M_s^{-1}
 \text{ is satisfied by the swap but does not select it uniquely}.}
                                                               \tag{24}
\]

The phrase “physical inversion” names the displayed criterion. It does not
turn (19) into a lift-free statement. The matrix $M_s$ in (19) is the
inherited companion-space lift; a different lift could change the solution
locus. That dependence is displayed rather than hidden.

Nor does (23) prove that the inversion locus exhausts the full moduli space.
The theorem needs only the exact swap identity and the exact
positive-dimensionality of its solution family. No dimension, component
count, or global topology beyond that certificate is asserted for
$\mathfrak P_s$.

This criterion therefore pins no unique completion. It remains physically
meaningful as a compatibility test, but it cannot by itself carry the
stronger claim that the swap is canonical simpliciter.

## 6. The Eigenline Exclusion

The commutation criterion asks for

\[
 [\Theta,M_s]=0.                                \tag{25}
\]

The certified stable direction is an $M_s$-eigenline. Write

\[
 M_sx_s=\lambda_s x_s,
 \qquad
 E_{\lambda_s}(M_s)=\operatorname{span}\{x_s\}.
                                                               \tag{26}
\]

Every completion in the moduli has the boundary action (10), so

\[
 \Theta x_s=\mu y_s,
 \qquad \mu\ne0.                               \tag{27}
\]

The other boundary vector $y_s$ straddles the inherited grading. In the
displayed graded split, both of its graded components are nonzero; in
particular,

\[
 y_s\notin\operatorname{span}\{x_s\}.           \tag{28}
\]

Suppose (25) held. Applying it to (26) would give

\[
 M_s(\Theta x_s)
 =\Theta(M_sx_s)
 =\lambda_s\Theta x_s.                         \tag{29}
\]

Thus $\Theta x_s$ would lie in the one-dimensional eigenspace
$E_{\lambda_s}(M_s)$ and would be proportional to $x_s$. Equations
(27)--(28) say instead that it is the nonzero multiple $\mu y_s$, which is
not on that eigenline. This contradiction proves

\[
 \{\Theta\in\mathfrak M_s:[\Theta,M_s]=0\}
 =\varnothing.                                 \tag{30}
\]

The proof is uniform over the extension constant $A_s$, the complement
involution $J_s$, its signature $r$, and the admissible normalization
$\mu$. Those parameters cannot repair a contradiction already forced on
the boundary-data span. Commutation with the monodromy is therefore
excluded for every member of the displayed moduli.

Spectral-projector expressibility dies by the same argument. Any operator
built only from the spectral projectors of $M_s$ has the form

\[
 F(M_s)=\sum_\alpha c_\alpha P_{\alpha,s}       \tag{31}
\]

on the displayed spectral decomposition, and hence

\[
 [F(M_s),M_s]=0.                               \tag{32}
\]

If a completion $\Theta$ were expressible in the displayed spectral
projectors, (32) would imply (25), contradicting (30). Therefore

\[
 \{\Theta\in\mathfrak M_s:
   \Theta\text{ is expressible in the spectral projectors of }M_s\}
 =\varnothing.                                 \tag{33}
\]

This is an exclusion of the displayed spectral-projector criterion, not of
all possible functional, geometric, local, or Ward-compatible
constructions. In particular, an expression involving data which do not
commute with $M_s$ is outside (31).

There is no conflict between (22) and (30). Inversion conjugates $M_s$ to
$M_s^{-1}$; commutation would leave $M_s$ fixed. The swap and its
positive-dimensional inversion family can satisfy the first relation while
every moduli member fails the second.

## 7. The Minimality Selection

The displayed minimality condition removes completion data not forced by
the boundary pairing. In the exact parametrization (11), its solution is

\[
 A_s=0,
 \qquad
 J_s=J_s^{\mathrm{sw}}.                         \tag{34}
\]

Equation (34) removes the eight-dimensional compatible constant and the
arbitrary complement-involution direction. It does not act on the relative
normalization $\mu$ in (10).

Consequently the unnormalized minimal locus is

\[
 \mathfrak M_s^{\min}
 =\{\Theta_s(\mu,0,J_s^{\mathrm{sw}}):
       \mu\text{ admissible and nonzero}\}.     \tag{35}
\]

Every point of (35) has the same minimal extension and complement data, but
different members rescale the two directions exchanged by the boundary
swap. Minimality alone therefore leaves a $\mu$-family.

The inherited symmetric normalization is the additional condition

\[
 \mu=1.                                        \tag{36}
\]

Combining (34) and (36) gives

\[
 \mathfrak M_s^{\min}\cap\{\mu=1\}
 =\{\Theta_s^{\mathrm{sw}}\}.                  \tag{37}
\]

This is the exact uniqueness statement. It has two premises: displayed
minimality and the $\mu=1$ normalization. Suppressing the second premise
would turn the family (35) into a false singleton.

The logical comparison of the four criteria is now complete:

\[
 \begin{array}{c|c}
 \text{criterion} & \text{solution set in the displayed moduli}\hline
 \Theta M_s\Theta=M_s^{-1}
   & \text{positive-dimensional and contains the swap}\
 [\Theta,M_s]=0
   & \varnothing\
 \text{spectral-projector expressibility}
   & \varnothing\
 \text{minimality without }\mu=1
   & \text{a }\mu\text{-family}\
 \text{minimality with }\mu=1
   & \{\Theta_s^{\mathrm{sw}}\}
 \end{array}                                   \tag{38}
\]

No row above selects the swap unconditionally. The last row selects it
conditionally on both named inputs. That distinction is exactly what the
verdict canonical-as-minimal-normalized records.

Minimality is not elevated to a new axiom. It is one displayed selection
rule applied to the already classified completion moduli. Nor is
$\mu=1$ derived from inversion, commutation, or spectral expressibility in
this note.

## 8. What Naturality Means Here

The completion is data-derived. Its boundary exchange follows from the
certified half-space pairing, reflection reality, and involutive
intertwining contract. Its swap point is not an arbitrary matrix appended
after the fact.

But data-derived does not mean criterion-unique. The exact parametrization
(11) contains extension and complement-involution freedom. Physical
inversion preserves a positive-dimensional part of that freedom.
Commutation and spectral-projector expressibility are incompatible with
the required boundary exchange and therefore return no preferred point.
Minimality removes the internal freedom but retains the $\mu$
normalization until $\mu=1$ is supplied.

The honest naturality statement is therefore:

\[
 \boxed{
 \text{the swap completion is canonical-as-minimal-normalized,
 not criterion-unique simpliciter}.}            \tag{39}
\]

The first half of (39) is positive. Once the inherited minimality rule and
symmetric boundary normalization are named, the swap is the unique point
(37). The second half is a firewall. Neither admissibility nor any one of
the displayed unconditional criteria isolates that point.

This also explains why the moduli freedom is a resource rather than a
defect. Block 126 found a genuine descending member $O_s^\star$ which fails
adjointness for the inherited swap completion. The classification here
exhibits the complete displayed domain over which another induced
adjointness can be tested. A direction in $(A_s,J_s,\mu)$ may change that
adjointness while preserving the baseline half-space completion conditions.

The next question is not whether the moduli should be erased by rhetoric.
It is the Block 129 moduli-adjointness hinge:

\[
 \exists\,\Theta\in\mathfrak M_s
 \quad\text{such that}\quad
 (O_s^\star)^{\sharp_\Theta}=O_s^\star\ ?       \tag{40}
\]

Equation (40) is posed, not solved. The present theorem neither produces a
member satisfying it nor excludes all such members. Additional physical
axioms, including Ward compatibility or locality, could reduce or even
collapse the moduli. Testing that possibility is exactly the hinge's
business.

The same restraint applies to criteria not displayed here. A geometric,
functorial, local, Ward-compatible, or curved-carrier criterion might pin a
point. This theorem classifies the displayed moduli and evaluates the four
displayed criteria; it does not quantify over every conceivable notion of
naturality.

Accordingly, “moduli” is not a synonym for “unphysical ambiguity,” and
“minimal-normalized” is not a synonym for “unique without assumptions.”
The former names the live search space for (40). The latter names exactly
the two conditions under which the swap is selected.

## 9. No-Go Discipline Gate

There is exactly one bounded naturality wall.

- W1 — **DISPLAYED-CRITERION NONSELECTION WALL:** no displayed criterion
  uniquely selects the swap completion unconditionally. Physical inversion
  holds for the swap and a positive-dimensional family; commutation and
  spectral-projector expressibility hold for no moduli member; and
  unnormalized minimality leaves a $\mu$-family.

W1 is narrow to the four displayed criteria: physical inversion with the
inherited companion-space monodromy lift, commutation with that lift,
spectral-projector expressibility in that lift, and the displayed
minimality rule without the $\mu=1$ normalization.

W1 is not an OS no-go and does not deny the conditional selection
(37). Minimality together with
$\mu=1$ pins the swap uniquely, which is why the honest verdict is
canonical-as-minimal-normalized. W1 says only that none of the displayed
criteria selects the swap without a named qualifier.

W1 does not cover another geometric, functorial, Ward-compatible, local,
or curved-carrier naturality criterion. It does not decide whether the
moduli-adjointness hinge selects a member or whether additional physical
axioms collapse the moduli. Those routes remain live.

Equivalently: the swap is a distinguished minimal-normalized point in an
exactly classified moduli space, but the displayed unconditional criteria
do not make it the unique point.

### N1 — Alternative Route Enumeration

Routes are normalized by (object, mechanism, terminal). Classification,
criterion behavior, conditional selection, and the next physical hinge
remain separate.

1. **PROVED — strongest dimension law / exact decomposition into the
   eight-real-dimensional compatible constant and the complement
   involution stratum / fixed-$\mu$ real dimension exactly
   $8+2r(4-r)$.** This is the strongest theorem and includes the placement
   of the swap as one point of the moduli.
2. **PROVED — eigenline exclusion / the stable direction $x_s$ is an
   $M_s$-eigenline while every completion sends it to the straddling vector
   $y_s$ / commutation and spectral-projector expressibility are excluded
   for every member.** The contradiction occurs before complement
   parameters can intervene.
3. **PROVED — inversion family / solve
   $\Theta M_s\Theta=M_s^{-1}$ on the displayed companion space / the swap
   satisfies the identity exactly but belongs to a positive-dimensional
   solution family.** Physical inversion does not isolate it.
4. **PROVED — minimality selection / remove the compatible constant and
   complement freedom, then inspect the boundary normalization / a
   $\mu$-family remains until $\mu=1$, after which the swap is unique.**
   This is the canonical-as-minimal-normalized verdict.
5. **FRAMED / LIVE RESOURCE — completion moduli / use the classified
   $(\mu,A_s,J_s)$ freedom to vary the induced reflection adjoint / pose the
   descending-member hinge (40).** The freedom is the search domain, not an
   asserted physical defect.
6. **UNTESTED-LIVE — the hinge, the curved dependency, and the bridge /
   test whether any moduli member admits $O_s^\star$, insert the common
   differential, and execute the cross-lane facet-charge bridge / decide
   whether the descended observable survives the next physical package.**
   No result on these terminals is imported here.

The completed ADM/history transporter, joint gravity, and the gravity
constraint quotient beyond the displayed carrier remain downstream of row
6. W1 consumes none of those routes.

### N2 — Wall-Independence Audit

W1 is independent of Block 126's time-dressing
reflection-adjointness wall, anchored in its No-Go Discipline Gate.

[Block 126](ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_TIME_DRESSING_ADJOINTNESS_WALL_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-17.md)
asked whether displayed time-conjugated current operators could descend
with nonzero quotient compression and satisfy the inherited swap
adjointness. Its decisive mechanism was the exact nonzero adjointness
residual of the genuine descending member $O_s^\star$; its terminal was an
empty displayed joint descent-plus-adjointness solve.

The present W1 does not solve an operator descent equation and does not use
that residual. It classifies the completion intertwiners themselves and
asks whether four displayed naturality criteria isolate the inherited swap
point. Its mechanisms are a dimension count, an inversion-locus solve, the
boundary eigenline contradiction, and the normalized-minimality split.

The walls therefore have different objects and mechanisms:

\[
 \begin{array}{c|c|c}
 \text{block} & \text{mechanism} & \text{terminal}\\\hline
 126 & \text{reflection-adjointness residual} &
       \text{displayed descending member rejected}\\
 127 & \text{moduli and criterion classification} &
       \text{no unconditional displayed selection}
 \end{array}                                    \tag{41}
\]

There is an intentional dependency. Block 126 uses the swap-induced
adjointness and leaves another completion open; Block 127 classifies the
displayed space of those completions. Dependency does not merge the walls.
The former is an observable-operator obstruction for selected classes. The
latter is a naturality nonselection statement for selected criteria.

Together they expose the next hinge: a time-dressed operator reaches the
quotient but fails the swap adjointness, while the swap sits inside a
nontrivial completion moduli. Neither block determines whether some other
member makes $O_s^\star$ adjoint.

### N3 — Hidden-Wall And Phrase Scan

The required H-gate scope-certificate phrase scan is classified explicitly.
Every hit in the left column is lowercase as required.

| lowercase hit | classification |
|---|---|
| certified package | the inherited finite half-space package only |
| both rational shear fixtures | exactly $s=5/13$ and $s=3/5$ |

| n1 n2 n3 n4 n5 n6 n7 n8 | every discipline gate is present |
| w1 | the wall set has exactly one member |
| per_element per_site per_mode per_block lattice_wide | five N5 keys |

No phrase upgrades canonical-as-minimal-normalized into uniqueness or
canonicity simpliciter. Nothing turns the failure of the two negative
criteria into nonexistence of a natural completion. Nothing declares the
moduli unphysical or says that additional physical axioms cannot reduce it.

Nothing asserts a solution of the moduli-adjointness hinge, curved-carrier
compatibility, completion of the facet-charge bridge or transporter, joint
gravity, axiom amendment, audit retention, obligation retirement, or TOE
percentage movement.

### N4 — Residual Matching

The Block 126 handoff next gate, quoted byte-exactly, is:

> The naturality classification of the swap completion; the curved-carrier
> dependency (the Block 105 common differential); reflection-compatible
> observable classes.

| source anchor | exact inherited residual | current match |
|---|---|---|
| [Block 126 next gate](ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_TIME_DRESSING_ADJOINTNESS_WALL_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-17.md), `docs/ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_TIME_DRESSING_ADJOINTNESS_WALL_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-17.md:16` | “The naturality classification of the swap completion; the curved-carrier dependency (the Block 105 common differential); reflection-compatible observable classes.” | the naturality clause is decided for the displayed completion class and criteria: exact moduli, nonselective inversion, eigenline exclusions, and canonical-as-minimal-normalized selection; the curved dependency and adjointness hinge remain |
| [Block 119 completion](ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_REFLECTION_INTERTWINER_COMPLETION_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-16.md) | the reflection-reality-covariant swap completes the boundary pairing | that completion is now placed as the point $(1,0,J_s^{\mathrm{sw}})$ in the exactly classified moduli (11)--(14) |
| [Block 119 naturality firewall](ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_REFLECTION_INTERTWINER_COMPLETION_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-16.md) | the supplied swap completion did not establish unconditional naturality or uniqueness | the question is answered honestly for the displayed criteria: not unique simpliciter, but uniquely minimal after the $\mu=1$ normalization |

This is a partial closure of Block 126's next gate. The naturality
classification is executed for the displayed completion class and four
criteria. The curved-carrier dependency remains unexecuted. The
reflection-compatible-observable route has been sharpened into the
moduli-adjointness hinge, but no member admitting $O_s^\star$ is claimed.

The phrase “naturality classification is executed” means equations
(11)--(39) on the certified carrier. It does not classify all functorial,
local, Ward-compatible, geometric, or curved notions of naturality.

### N5 — Rhetoric And Granularity Audit

The strongest permitted sentence is: “On the certified package at both
rational shear fixtures, the reflection-reality-covariant involutive
completions form an exactly classified moduli whose fixed-$\mu$ stratum has
real dimension $8+2r(4-r)$; the swap is one point, physical inversion holds
for it and a positive-dimensional family, commutation and
spectral-projector expressibility are excluded for every member by the
stable-eigenline-to-straddling-vector argument, and minimality selects the
swap uniquely only with $\mu=1$, so the honest verdict is
canonical-as-minimal-normalized.”

Forbidden upgrades include:

- “the completion is unique/canonical simpliciter”;
- “no natural completion exists”; and
- “the moduli freedom is unphysical.”

The first erases the exact positive-dimensional moduli and the qualifier in
(37). The second turns failure of two displayed criteria into a universal
no-go. The third pre-judges the live physical test (40).

Also forbidden are “physical inversion uniquely pins the swap,” “every
notion of spectral construction fails,” “minimality fixes $\mu$,” “no
additional physical axiom can collapse the moduli,” “the descending member
is admitted by another completion,” and “the curved-carrier dependency is
solved.” None is established here.

The five N5 resolution lines fixed for the runner are reproduced verbatim:

```text
N5: per_element: reflection-reality covariance, involutivity, boundary mu-swap, orthocomplement-involution parametrization, dimension-law, inversion-family, eigenline-exclusion, spectral-projector-exclusion, and normalized-minimality certificates are checked
per_site: one Grassmann mode per fine site on the antiperiodic reflection torus
per_mode: at fixed mu the completion moduli stratum with +1-eigenspace dimension r has exact real dimension 8 + 2r(4-r), and the swap completion is one point
per_block: physical inversion holds for the swap and a positive-dimensional family; commutation and spectral-projector expressibility fail for every member; minimality selects the swap only with mu = 1 normalization
lattice_wide: checked and not executed — the moduli-adjointness hinge, the curved-carrier dependency, the cross-lane facet-charge bridge, the actual ADM/history transporter completion, joint gravity, the gravity constraint quotient beyond the displayed carrier, Records, audit retention, and TOE closure remain open
```

### N6 — Partial-Closure Path Scan

No registered primitive is needed. The result classifies the displayed
completion space without promoting any selection criterion to an axiom.

| route | present status | remaining terminal |
|---|---|---|
| baseline completion conditions | exact admissible class | impose no naturality selector |
| boundary-data span | exact $\mu$-swap | normalization remains variable |
| orthocomplement | arbitrary compatible involution | stratify by $r$ |
| extension data | real dimension eight | additional criteria may reduce it |
| complement stratum | real dimension $2r(4-r)$ | additional criteria may reduce it |
| fixed-$\mu$ moduli | exact dimension $8+2r(4-r)$ | physical status not assigned |
| swap completion | one classified point | test selection criteria |
| physical inversion | exact at the swap | positive-dimensional family remains |
| monodromy commutation | empty for every member | displayed criterion selects nothing |
| spectral-projector expression | empty for every member | other constructions remain live |
| unnormalized minimality | $\mu$-family | add symmetric normalization |
| minimality plus $\mu=1$ | unique swap point | conditional selection only |
| naturality verdict | canonical-as-minimal-normalized | no simpliciter upgrade |
| moduli-adjointness hinge | untested-live | test whether a member admits $O_s^\star$ |
| Ward compatibility and locality | untested-live | may reduce or collapse moduli |
| curved-carrier dependency | not executed | insert the common differential |
| cross-lane facet-charge bridge | not executed | join the certified interfaces |
| actual ADM/history transporter | not executed | complete beyond the displayed package |
| gravity constraint quotient | displayed carrier only | execute beyond that carrier |

The scan finds no axiom-amendment route. The naturality clause of Block
126's next gate is discharged for the displayed class and criteria. The
remaining terminals are the moduli-adjointness hinge, curved dependence,
the cross-lane bridge, the completed transporter, and gravity beyond the
displayed carrier.

### N7 — Steelman

**Hostile steelman: a criterion not displayed here might pin the swap.** A
functorial, local, geometric, Ward-compatible, or curved criterion could
select one point even though inversion, commutation, spectral-projector
expressibility, and unnormalized minimality do not.

Agreed. W1 quantifies only over the displayed list. The theorem does not
say that no selection principle exists. Such a criterion is open and named
rather than absorbed into the no-go.

**Hostile steelman: additional physical axioms could collapse the moduli.**
Ward compatibility or locality might remove the extension constant,
restrict $J_s$, fix $\mu$, or leave only the swap.

Agreed. Equations (11)--(18) classify the completions before those
additional tests. Applying them is exactly the business of the
moduli-adjointness hinge and its successors. Calling the moduli a live
resource does not guarantee that every direction survives physical tests.

**Hostile steelman: the inversion identity is lift-dependent.** Equation
(19) uses a companion-space monodromy representative, so another lift may
produce a different inversion locus.

Agreed, and displayed. The symbol $M_s$ throughout Section 5 denotes the
inherited companion-space lift. The positive-dimensionality result and the
swap identity are certified for that lift only. No lift-independent
inversion theorem is claimed.

These steelmen preserve narrow W1. They identify live selection routes and
possible reductions of the moduli without changing the exact outcome of
the four criteria actually executed.

### N8 — Cross-Cycle Echo

The immediate campaign chain separated reflection completion,
time-dressed adjointness, and naturality of the completion.

| campaign block | narrowing that leads to W1 and the live route |
|---|---|
| [Block 119](ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_REFLECTION_INTERTWINER_COMPLETION_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-16.md) | supplied the reflection-reality-covariant swap completion and left unconditional naturality outside its firewall |
| [Block 126](ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_TIME_DRESSING_ADJOINTNESS_WALL_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-17.md) | produced a genuine descending member, showed that the inherited swap adjoint rejects it, and named alternative completion adjointness as live |
| Block 127 | classifies the completion moduli, places the swap as one point, proves the dimension law and criterion outcomes, and exposes that moduli as the search space for the descending-member hinge |

The present result does not infer uniqueness from the exact inversion
identity. The positive-dimensional inversion locus blocks that inference.
Nor does it infer nonexistence of naturality from the empty commutation and
spectral-projector loci. Conditional minimal-normalized selection is an
explicit positive result.

**No-Go Discipline verdict:** **PASS** only for narrow W1. None of physical
inversion, monodromy commutation, spectral-projector expressibility, or
unnormalized minimality uniquely selects the swap completion on the
certified package at either fixture. **POSITIVE** for the exact moduli
classification, the fixed-$\mu$ dimension $8+2r(4-r)$, the exact swap
inversion identity, and the unique minimal selection after $\mu=1$.
**LIVE RESOURCE** for the completion moduli as the domain of the
descending-member hinge. **FAIL** for uniqueness or canonicity simpliciter,
nonexistence of a natural completion, a declaration that the moduli is
unphysical, a solution of the hinge, exhaustion of all selection criteria,
lift-independent inversion, curved compatibility, a completed cross-lane
bridge or ADM/history transporter, joint gravity, a quotient beyond the
displayed carrier, axiom necessity, audit retention, obligation retirement,
or TOE movement.

## 10. Axiom And TOE Disposition

No axiom amendment is justified. The moduli parametrization, dimension law,
inversion solve, eigenline exclusions, and conditional minimality selection
are finite consequences of the displayed half-space pairing, reflection
reality, monodromy lift, boundary data, orthocomplement, and two rational
shear fixtures. No new primitive is assumed.

Calling the swap canonical-as-minimal-normalized in (39) diagnoses a
conditional selection inside the displayed moduli. It is not authorization
to add minimality or $\mu=1$ as an axiom, to delete other moduli members, or
to declare those members unphysical before the hinge is executed.

This is bounded route closure, not an audit-grade assignment. It retires no
end-to-end obligation. TOE accounting remains:

- zero obligation retirement;
- no TOE percentage moves; and
- retained-positive end-to-end theory count remains zero.

## 11. Next Decision

The shortest high-value sequence is:

1. execute the moduli-adjointness hinge: does any moduli member admit the
   descending member $O_s^\star$?;
2. execute the curved-carrier dependency by inserting the common
   differential into any descended reflection-compatible class which
   survives; and
3. execute the cross-lane facet-charge bridge on that surviving package.

The actual ADM/history transporter remains unexecuted beyond the displayed
half-space positive package, its contractive parity-paired transfer, the
balanced sourced Gauss graph modulo constant gauge, the bounded
time-dressing adjointness wall, and the classified completion moduli.

Reflection positivity on the curved carrier remains unexecuted; in
particular, the common differential has not been propagated through a
reflection-compatible descended observable class.

The gravity constraint quotient remains unexecuted beyond the displayed
balanced carrier.
