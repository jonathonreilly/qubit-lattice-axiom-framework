## 1. Result Up Front

[Block 104](ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_WICK_PHASE_FINE_SITE_STAGGERED_OS_LORENTZ_BOUNDARY_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md)
placed the flat Dirac–Kähler carrier exactly on one staggered Grassmann mode
per fine site, but used one declared even-cell origin. The Lattice axiom gives
no physical privilege to that origin. This note executes the first curved
translation test.

The result has one exact failure and two positive repairs.

First, the one-site staggered shifts are not an obstruction. In the ordered
basis `(1, dx, dt, dx∧dt)` their normalized lifts are

\[
 R_t=Y\otimes I,\qquad R_x=Z\otimes Y,         \tag{1}
\]

and

\[
 R_t^2=R_x^2=I,\qquad R_tR_x=-R_xR_t.           \tag{2}
\]

The minus sign is central. Consequently the adjoint actions commute exactly:

\[
 \operatorname{Ad}_{R_t}\operatorname{Ad}_{R_x}
 =\operatorname{Ad}_{R_x}\operatorname{Ad}_{R_t}. \tag{3}
\]

Thus a projective vector lift gives an honest `Z2^2` action on
operators. A vector lift still needs a spin/Z2 choice; the operator action
does not.

Second, the literal demand that the same generic curved Hodge operator be an
onsite `H_site` direct sum in every parity partition fails. The exact
`Z4^2` fine-torus witness has off-block residual ranks

\[
 (0,8,8,8)                                      \tag{4}
\]

in origins `00, 01, 10, 11`. The corresponding physical-Hodge tangent
spaces have dimension 12 each, while successive intersection dimensions are

\[
 12\longrightarrow4\longrightarrow2\longrightarrow2. \tag{5}
\]

The last two directions are only the diagonal parity modes
`(-1)^x` and `(-1)^t`; shear is absent. This is a narrow
simultaneous-onsite boundary, not a Hodge or gravity no-go.

The minimal repair is exact: choose one origin only as a gauge section and
transport `N, d, H, Q_E` together between the four descriptions. All exterior
identities survive, while a shifted chart is allowed to display interblock
support. The stronger origin-free candidate is

\[
 H_{\rm ov}[g]={1\over4}\sum_{n\in\mathbb Z_4^2}
 E_nH_{\rm site}(g_n)E_n^\dagger.             \tag{6}
\]

It is strictly positive, flat-normalized, bounded-local, one-mode-per-site,
and exactly translation covariant. It is also a coframe Gram. But averaging
the whole Dirac–Kähler complex is not allowed:

\[
 \bar N=I,\qquad
 \bar d^{\,2}={s_x^2+s_t^2\over4}I,\qquad
 \det\bar d={(s_x^2+s_t^2)^2\over16}.         \tag{7}
\]

Therefore overlap Hodge alone is not a full Dirac-Kahler repair. The next
precise lemma is a transition-compatible nilpotent differential on the
redundant patch carrier whose physical range is invariant, or an equivalent
discrete frame connection. The actual ADM/history transporter and its
reflection Gram remain the next physical gravity gate.

## 2. Authority And Executed Contract

Current axiom authority is
[MINIMAL_AXIOMS_2026-06-29.md](MINIMAL_AXIOMS_2026-06-29.md) at
`origin/main 43ba5587944ffe0f43df10864c8348a99c17517b`, with axiom blob
`bc23300becfe4e4db57153c0e94cfcdf2338da71`.

The exact stacked parent is Block 104 commit
`7fe07db6c03fad1191893c942f708c5cb9a54c43`. The runner content-binds the
parent note, runner, and cache. It does not import an audit verdict from that
parent.

The executed contract is:

1. the `d=2` invariant `x-t` plane and Block 104 form ordering;
2. normalized one-site shift lifts at zero coarse momentum, plus an exact
   global fine-torus chart calculation containing all torus modes;
3. Euclidean physical-Hodge tangents at the flat point;
4. a periodic `4 x 4` fine torus with four `2 x 2` coarse cells;
5. exact rational positive shear metrics;
6. active translations of both matter sites and geometry labels;
7. passive chart changes of one fixed geometry, kept distinct from active
   translations; and
8. Hodge positivity and support only—not a common differential, Ward, OS, or
   dynamical-gravity theorem for the overlap carrier.

The `d=2` counterexample embeds in a higher-dimensional carrier by tensoring
flat spectator axes, so a literal all-origin onsite claim in four dimensions
cannot evade it. No full `d=4` nonuniform construction is claimed here.

## 3. Exact One-Site Shift Algebra

Before the Block 104 Koszul phase, the two one-site staggered shifts are

\[
 \widetilde R_t=X\otimes Z,\qquad
 \widetilde R_x=I\otimes X.                    \tag{8}
\]

For

\[
 S=\operatorname{diag}(1,-i,-i,1),              \tag{9}
\]

direct multiplication gives `S† R_tilde_mu S = R_mu` in
(1). Equation (2) then gives a square-loop phase `-I`. This phase matters
for a vector lift, but cancels from every conjugation.

Let `R_o` be any chosen lift for `o in Z2^2`, and define

\[
 N_o=R_o^\dagger N_0R_o,\quad
 d_o=R_o^\dagger d_0R_o,\quad
 H_o=R_o^\dagger H_0R_o.                       \tag{10}
\]

With

\[
 Q_E(H,d)=mH+i(Hd+d^\dagger H),                 \tag{11}
\]

the runner verifies in all four frames

\[
 d_o^2=0,\qquad [N_o,d_o]=d_o,\qquad
 [N_o,H_o]=0,\qquad
 Q_E(H_o,d_o)=R_o^\dagger Q_E(H_0,d_0)R_o.      \tag{12}
\]

This is the first positive answer: the projective sign is not the
blocking-origin obstruction.

## 4. Why A Fixed Exterior Grading Fails

The Euclidean physical Hodge tangents from Block 103 are

\[
 A_{xx}={1\over2}\operatorname{diag}(1,-1,1,-1),\qquad
 A_{tt}={1\over2}\operatorname{diag}(1,1,-1,-1), \tag{13}
\]

and

\[
 (A_{xt})_{dx,dt}=(A_{xt})_{dt,dx}=-1.          \tag{14}
\]

Their commutator ranks with `(R_x, R_t)` are

| tangent | `R_x` rank | `R_t` rank |
|---|---:|---:|
| `A_xx` | 4 | 0 |
| `A_xt` | 4 | 4 |
| `A_tt` | 0 | 4 |

The shear orbit adds

\[
 A_{02}=R_xA_{xt}R_x,\qquad
 (A_{02})_{1,dx\wedge dt}=(A_{02})_{dx\wedge dt,1}=-1. \tag{15}
\]

The span of `(A_xx, A_xt, A_tt)` has dimension three; adjoining
`A_02` raises it to four. Moreover

\[
 [N_0,A_{xt}]=0,\qquad \operatorname{rank}[N_0,A_{02}]=2. \tag{16}
\]

No nonzero linear combination of the three physical tangents commutes with
both shifts, and the Reynolds average of each tangent over the four adjoint
frames is zero.

There is also a representation-independent combinatorial statement. A
diagonal grade commuting with both raw one-site shifts in (8) must be scalar:
the exact constraint matrix has rank three on four grade entries. A
transitive one-site translation action therefore cannot preserve the fixed
nonconstant census `(0, 1, 1, 2)`. The degree must co-transform, or a genuine
frame connection must replace the fixed census.

## 5. Nonuniform Fine-Torus Witness

Let the fine lattice be `Z4_t x Z4_x`. For an anchor `n`, `E_n`
embeds the four ordered offsets `(00, 01, 10, 11)` into the fine sites
`n+A`. Let `B_o` list those sites as `2N+o+A` for parity origin `o`.

For

\[
 g(q)=\begin{pmatrix}1&q\\q&1\end{pmatrix},\qquad
 s=\sqrt{1-q^2},                                \tag{17}
\]

the exact physical Hodge is

\[
 H_{\rm site}(q)=
 \begin{pmatrix}
 s&0&0&0\\
 0&s^{-1}&-q/s&0\\
 0&-q/s&s^{-1}&0\\
 0&0&0&s^{-1}
 \end{pmatrix}.                                 \tag{18}
\]

The onsite witness uses

\[
 q=3/5,\ 5/13,\ 8/17,\ 7/25,                 \tag{19}
\]

with `s=4/5, 12/13, 15/17, 24/25`. Every block is exactly positive. Assemble

\[
 H_{\rm fix}=B_{00}^\dagger
 \left(\bigoplus_NH_{\rm site}(q_N)\right)B_{00}. \tag{20}
\]

The off-block part of `B_o H_fix B_o†` has the ranks in (4).
An arbitrary block-diagonal chart unitary cannot remove one of those
cross-blocks because

\[
 \operatorname{rank}(U_N^\dagger F_{NM}U_M)
 =\operatorname{rank}F_{NM}.                   \tag{21}
\]

At the linearized level, let `S_o` contain an independent
`(A_xx, A_xt, A_tt)` triple on each of the four blocks in origin `o`.
The exact intersection calculation gives (5), with final span precisely
`((-1)^x, (-1)^t)`. It rescues a narrow diagonal subfamily, not generic shear.

This proves only:

> The same generic shear Hodge cannot be a direct sum of onsite physical
> `H_site` blocks in every parity cover.

It does not prove that translation-covariant Hodge geometry, a frame gauge,
or gravity fails.

## 6. Minimal Global Frame-Gauge Repair

Define in the origin-`00` section

\[
 N_{\rm glob}=B_{00}^\dagger
 \left(\bigoplus_NN_0\right)B_{00}.           \tag{22}
\]

In chart `o`, transport the same operator:

\[
 F_o=B_oH_{\rm fix}B_o^\dagger,\qquad
 N_o^{\rm tr}=B_oN_{\rm glob}B_o^\dagger.     \tag{23}
\]

The commutator ranks `rank[N_o^tr,F_o]` are `(0, 0, 0, 0)`.
Resetting to the canonical onsite grade in every chart instead gives
`(0, 8, 8, 0)`. The transported-minus-canonical grade ranks are
`(0, 16, 16, 8)`.

Thus the global section is a gauge convention only if all four descriptions
are quotiented by their exact signed transitions and `N, d, H, Q_E` are
transported together. In shifted charts, some of them are necessarily
coarse-interblock. A fixed blocking origin is not admissible as physical
structure under the Lattice axiom, but a gauge-fixed representation with
exact transition data need not privilege a physical site.

This minimal repair preserves the Block 103 exterior identities. It does not
yet supply a locally varying frame connection or an OS theorem.

## 7. Positive Origin-Free Overlap Hodge

For a geometry field at every fine anchor, define (6). The runner uses the
eight exact pairs

\[
 (q,s)=
 (0,1),(3/5,4/5),(5/13,12/13),(8/17,15/17),
 (7/25,24/25),(20/29,21/29),(12/37,35/37),(9/41,40/41), \tag{24}
\]

assigned by `q_(t,x) = Q_((3t+x) mod 8)`.

Four exact properties follow.

1. **Flat normalization.** Every fine site lies in four patches, so
   `H_ov[0] = I`.
2. **Strict positivity.** Each `H_site(q_n)` is positive, and the smallest
   site eigenvalue in (24) is `3/7`. Hence
   \[
   H_{\rm ov}\succeq {3\over7}I.              \tag{25}
   \]
   All sixteen exact leading principal minors in the witness are positive.
3. **Translation covariance.** If `U_a e_x = e_(x+a)` and
   `(T_a g)_(n+a) = g_n`, then
   \[
   U_aH_{\rm ov}[g]U_a^\dagger=H_{\rm ov}[T_ag] \tag{26}
   \]
   for `a=x,t,x+t`, exactly.
4. **One physical mode per site.** The result acts on the original
   sixteen-dimensional fine carrier. Patch components are redundant, not new
   physical copies.

It is also an exact coframe Gram. Define the redundant analysis map

\[
 \mathcal E_g={1\over2}\bigoplus_n
 H_{\rm site}(g_n)^{1/2}E_n^\dagger.           \tag{27}
\]

Then `E_g† E_g = H_ov[g]`, and `E_0† E_0 = I`. This is a tight overlapping
cochain-frame candidate on the original fine field.

The overlap Hodge is a candidate carrier repair, not a completed action.

The construction is necessarily interblock: its off-block residual ranks in
the four parity partitions are `(16, 16, 16, 12)`. That support is the repair,
not a defect.

## 8. The Remaining Descent Boundary

For each canonical origin grade `N_o`, the runner finds

\[
 \operatorname{rank}[N_o,H_{\rm ov}]=8.        \tag{28}
\]

The average grade collapses to `I`, and (7) proves that the naive averaged
differential is generically invertible. Thus neither averaging the degree nor
averaging the differential supplies a Dirac–Kähler complex.

The three nontrivial `Z2^2` character projections do not rescue this averaging
route. For the `t`, `x`, and mixed characters, respectively, the projected
differential ranks are `(4,4,0)` and the determinants are
`(s_t^4/16,s_x^4/16,0)`. The only nilpotent character component is therefore
the zero operator.

The strongest next mathematical target is:

> Construct a uniformly bounded finite-range, transition-compatible
> nilpotent differential on the redundant patch carrier whose physical
> analysis-map range is invariant and whose pullback reproduces the same
> graded Ward action and signed staggered shifts; or construct an equivalent
> local discrete `Z2^d` frame connection.

The algebraic pseudoinverse decoration
`d_ext=E_g d (E_g^dag E_g)^(-1) E_g^dag` does not by itself meet this target:
for a generic nonuniform Gram its inverse can be dense, and range invariance
alone does not establish signed-shift, degree, Ward, or same-action
compatibility. Uniform finite-range locality and the action pullback are
load-bearing parts of the next lemma.

A successful range-invariance/descent lemma would combine the positive
coframe Gram with the Block 103 Ward algebra. A failure would expose the exact
connection/contact residual. A common global nilpotent differential remains
unexecuted. The actual ADM/history transporter remains unexecuted.
Reflection positivity remains unexecuted.

## 9. Constant-Metric Positive Boundary And ADM Parity

For a constant positive metric

\[
 g=\begin{pmatrix}a&c\\c&b\end{pmatrix},\qquad \Delta=ab-c^2>0, \tag{29}
\]

let `H` be the physical exterior Hodge and `M=Hd+d†H`. The exact
normalized matter operator obeys

\[
 D_g=H^{-1}M,\qquad
 D_g^2=(s^Tg^{-1}s)I.                           \tag{30}
\]

It is `H`-self-adjoint, so its `H^(1/2)`-normalized form is a Hermitian
Clifford operator. Since `det H=1` on the full two-dimensional exterior
carrier,

\[
 \det(mH+iM)=(m^2+s^Tg^{-1}s)^2>0              \tag{31}
\]

away from the simultaneous massless zero mode. The runner also verifies
positive determinants on all rational fixtures in (24).

Time reflection has pullback `P_t=diag(1,1,-1,-1)` and

\[
 P_tH(a,b,c)P_t=H(a,b,-c).                      \tag{32}
\]

Therefore the off-diagonal metric component `c=g_xt`, equivalently the
minimal ADM shift, is reflection odd. A same-sign history pairing is not the
correct OS test. The next transporter must reverse the negative-half shift
and derive the seam-frame overlap from the same action.

## 10. No-Go Discipline Gate

There are exactly two narrow finite-witness statements:

- `W1`: the displayed generic-shear `H_fix` is not coarse-onsite in all four
  parity covers of the same fixed geometry, even after invertible block-local
  chart changes; and
- `W2`: Reynolds/origin averaging of the displayed four conjugate exterior
  frames does not preserve a nontrivial exterior grading and a nonzero
  nilpotent differential.

Neither is a blocking, cochain, Hodge, translation, gravity, axiom, or TOE
no-go. The retained foundation licenses only the translation/no-privileged-
site target: [Lattice, lines 35–41](MINIMAL_AXIOMS_2026-06-29.md#lattice--physical-locality).
It does **not** prove the new matrix ranks below. Those ranks are current-cycle
evidence in runner checks `C`, `E`, `F`, and `G`. The physical Hodge and
fine-site carrier are content-bound unaudited dependencies, not imported
retained grades: Block 103 commit

### N1 — Alternative Route Enumeration

Routes are normalized by `(primary object/formulation, mechanism/invariant,
terminal obligation)`. A premise-changing rescue is recorded because it
attacks the statement, but it is explicitly not counted as an in-premise
counterexample.

#### W1 attacks

| normalized family | honesty | attempted route | why it does not overturn `W1` |
|---|---|---|---|
| passive parity reblocking / off-block matrix / zero cross-block terminal | **ATTEMPTED** | Re-express the same `H_fix` in all four parity charts and ask for every off-block matrix to vanish. | Current-cycle equations (19)–(21) and runner `E` give ranks `(0,8,8,8)`, so three required zeros fail. Retained target premise: [Lattice lines 35–41](MINIMAL_AXIOMS_2026-06-29.md#lattice--physical-locality); the rank result is new evidence, not axiom content. |
| block-local similarity / rank invariance / onsite terminal | **ATTEMPTED** | Allow an arbitrary invertible basis change independently inside every coarse block. | Equation (21) preserves each cross-block rank under invertible left/right maps, so a rank-eight block cannot become zero; runner `E` supplies the exact witness. Retained target premise: [Lattice lines 35–41](MINIMAL_AXIOMS_2026-06-29.md#lattice--physical-locality). |
| physical tangent reparametrization / subspace intersection / generic-shear terminal | **ATTEMPTED** | Search the full twelve-dimensional onsite physical-Hodge tangent space in each cover for a common generic shear direction. | Equation (5) and runner `E` give intersection dimensions `12,4,2,2`; the survivor is only the two diagonal parity modes, so no shear survives. The physical tangent premise is the content-bound unaudited Block 103 formula at `docs/ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_COCHAIN_HODGE_QUADRATIC_WARD_SHELL_LOCALITY_OS_REENTRY_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md:214-248`; the new intersection is current-cycle evidence. |
| fixed exterior census / translation commutant / nonconstant-grade terminal | **ATTEMPTED** | Keep one literal diagonal exterior grade while demanding invariance under both raw one-site shifts. | Runner `C` gives rank three on the four grade entries, so the commutant is scalar and cannot retain `(0,1,1,2)`. Retained target premise: [Lattice lines 35–41](MINIMAL_AXIOMS_2026-06-29.md#lattice--physical-locality); the commutant calculation is new evidence. |
| active field translation / covariant family / fixed-geometry reblocking terminal | **ATTEMPTED** | Translate the geometry labels together with the sites and use covariance (26) as a rescue. | Runner `F` verifies this positive equation, but it compares `g` with `T_a g`; `W1` passively reblocks one fixed `g`, so the route changes the quantified object. Retained distinction: no site is privileged under [Lattice lines 35–41](MINIMAL_AXIOMS_2026-06-29.md#lattice--physical-locality); equation (26) is current-cycle evidence. |
| overlapping coframe / partition of unity / positive covariant-Hodge terminal | **ATTEMPTED** | Replace the disjoint onsite sum by the all-anchor overlap `H_ov`. | Runner `F` succeeds, thereby defeating every broad Hodge no-go, but its shifted cross ranks `(16,16,16,12)` explicitly abandon `W1`'s simultaneous coarse-onsite premise. Retained target premise: [Lattice lines 35–41](MINIMAL_AXIOMS_2026-06-29.md#lattice--physical-locality); overlap positivity/covariance are current-cycle evidence. |

#### W2 attacks

| normalized family | honesty | attempted route | why it does not overturn `W2` |
|---|---|---|---|
| trivial-character grade projection / Reynolds invariant / nontrivial-grade terminal | **ATTEMPTED** | Arithmetic-average the four conjugate degree operators. | Equation (7) and runner `G` give `N_bar=I`, so the result carries no exterior census. The four-frame carrier is the content-bound unaudited Block 104 input at `docs/ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_WICK_PHASE_FINE_SITE_STAGGERED_OS_LORENTZ_BOUNDARY_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md:361-364`; the average is current-cycle evidence. |
| trivial-character differential projection / determinant invariant / nilpotent terminal | **ATTEMPTED** | Arithmetic-average the four conjugate differentials. | Equation (7) and runner `G` give `d_bar^2=(s_x^2+s_t^2)I/4` and a generically nonzero determinant, so the nonzero result is not nilpotent. The frame input is the same content-bound Block 104 source; the square and determinant are current-cycle evidence. |
| nontrivial-character Fourier projection / character sectors / nonzero-nilpotent terminal | **ATTEMPTED** | Replace the trivial average by each of the three nontrivial `Z2^2` character projections. | Runner `G` finds that the `t` and `x` characters have determinants `s_t^4/16` and `s_x^4/16`, while the mixed character gives the zero operator; none is a nonzero nilpotent differential. The group target is licensed by [Lattice lines 35–41](MINIMAL_AXIOMS_2026-06-29.md#lattice--physical-locality); these character calculations are current-cycle evidence. |
| overlap Hodge plus canonical degree / commutator rank / graded-Hodge terminal | **ATTEMPTED** | Keep `H_ov` and pair it with any one of the four canonical origin grades. | Equation (28) and runner `G` give commutator ranks `(8,8,8,8)`, so none is degree preserving. The `H_site` premise is the content-bound unaudited Block 103 source at `docs/ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_COCHAIN_HODGE_QUADRATIC_WARD_SHELL_LOCALITY_OS_REENTRY_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md:214-248`; the ranks are current-cycle evidence. |
| physical-Hodge Reynolds projection / tangent invariant / nonzero-geometry terminal | **ATTEMPTED** | Average each of the three physical Hodge tangents over the four adjoint frames. | Runner `C` gives zero for all three Reynolds averages, so this projection erases rather than preserves the nontrivial metric tangent. The physical tangent premise is the content-bound unaudited Block 103 source at `docs/ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_COCHAIN_HODGE_QUADRATIC_WARD_SHELL_LOCALITY_OS_REENTRY_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md:228-248`; the zero averages are current-cycle evidence. |
| transported complex / conjugation covariance / common-complex terminal | **ATTEMPTED** | Co-transform `N,d,H,Q_E` instead of averaging them. | Runner `D` succeeds exactly and defeats every broad complex no-go, but it is a gauge-section/conjugation construction, not the Reynolds/origin averaging asserted to fail in `W2`. Its need is licensed by the no-privileged-site target in [Lattice lines 35–41](MINIMAL_AXIOMS_2026-06-29.md#lattice--physical-locality); the covariance is current-cycle evidence. |

### N2 — Wall-Independence Audit

| pair | closing first automatically closes second? | closing second automatically closes first? | independent? | exact reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `(W1,W2)` | no | no | yes | `H_ov` abandons onsite support yet still has rank-eight canonical-grade commutators; transported `N,d,H,Q_E` preserves the complex yet leaves shifted-chart interblock support. |

There is no inflated third wall. Signed-shift locality, common action, ADM/OS,
joint gravity, Records, and retention are unexecuted terminals, not additional
premises needed for either finite statement. The collapsed set is `{W1,W2}`.

### N3 — Hidden-Wall Scan

The required phrase scan found no uses of “we assume,” “by construction,” “as
is standard,” “the framework provides,” “bridge context,” “background,”
“naturally,” “obviously,” or “standard QFT.” The hits and close variants that
do occur classify as follows.

| hit/variant | classification | explicit meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `canonical origin grade` | non-load-bearing convention | the displayed `N_o=B_o N_0 B_o^dagger`; “canonical” imports no authority or uniqueness |
| `gauge` | explicit supplied transition law | no local connection is silently imported; the signed transitions are part of runner `D` |
| `translation covariance` | retained target plus executed equation | active translation of sites and labels under (26), distinct from passive reblocking; [Lattice lines 35–41](MINIMAL_AXIOMS_2026-06-29.md#lattice--physical-locality) supplies only the target |
| `local` | explicit support convention | bounded fine-lattice support, not coarse-block onsite support |
| `one mode` | explicit carrier count | the original fine carrier; redundant patch-analysis components are not physical copies |
| `positive` | narrowed conclusion | positive Hodge/coframe Gram only, not OS positivity |
| `same action` | narrowed conclusion | exact only under transported `N,d,H`; not established here for `H_ov` |
| `ADM`, `gravity` | non-load-bearing future target | only reflection parity (32); no history measure, constraint quotient, or recoil |
| `axiom`, `retained`, `TOE` | accounting firewall | no amendment, verdict, retirement, or percentage movement |

No hit promotes a hidden condition to a third wall.

### N4 — Residual Matching

| cited witness (exact path and line) | witness residual | current residual | match? | disposition |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [Block 103](ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_COCHAIN_HODGE_QUADRATIC_WARD_SHELL_LOCALITY_OS_REENTRY_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md), `docs/ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_COCHAIN_HODGE_QUADRATIC_WARD_SHELL_LOCALITY_OS_REENTRY_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md:214-248` | metric-derived `H_site` and its physical tangents | `W1` tests whether that same physical tangent family is onsite in every parity cover | yes | content-bound unaudited dependency |
| `docs/ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_COCHAIN_HODGE_QUADRATIC_WARD_SHELL_LOCALITY_OS_REENTRY_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md:582-586` | coframe plus temporal/cross-history link still required | current overlap coframe leaves local signed-shift differential/action descent and temporal link unexecuted | yes | exact next-interface match, not negative support |
| `docs/ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_WICK_PHASE_FINE_SITE_STAGGERED_OS_LORENTZ_BOUNDARY_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md:361-364` | flat shifted origin is equivalent; nonuniform equivariance unexecuted | `W1` executes precisely passive nonuniform reblocking | yes | content-bound unaudited parent target |
| `docs/ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_WICK_PHASE_FINE_SITE_STAGGERED_OS_LORENTZ_BOUNDARY_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md:593-599` | blocking-origin covariance must be constructed or its exact failure exhibited | equations (19)–(28) give the exact failure and two positive repairs | yes | exact residual match |

No nonmatching prior obstruction is used, and neither parent contributes an
imported audit grade.

### N5 — Rhetoric And Granularity Audit

The strongest permitted sentence is: “The displayed generic onsite shear is
not simultaneously onsite in every parity cover of the fixed geometry, but
exact transported-frame and positive overlap-Hodge repairs survive.” Forbidden
upgrades include “blocking fails,” “Dirac–Kähler gravity fails,” “the overlap
carrier already has a common differential,” “curved matter is OS positive,”
and “a TOE obligation is retired.”

```text
per_element: exact projective shift lifts, Hodge tangents, metric Clifford identity, and reflection parity are checked
per_site: one fine Grassmann mode is retained at each of the 16 torus sites; no anchor copy is added
per_mode: the zero-coarse-momentum shear orbit adds the degree-changing A02 direction; fixed physical tangent invariants are zero
per_block: onsite nonuniform shear has shifted-chart cross rank 8; overlap repair cross ranks are 16/16/16/12
lattice_wide: checked and not executed — a uniformly finite-range signed-shift common d/Ward action, ADM/history common link, OS positivity, joint gravity, Records, selection, audit retention, and TOE closure remain open
```

The primary runner prints these five substantive lines verbatim, so the N5
certificate lands in cached stdout as well as in this note.

### N6 — Partial-Closure Path Scan

| candidate path | status/source | what it closes without a new axiom | remaining terminal |
|---|---|---|---|
| no-privileged-site reframe | approved foundation, `docs/MINIMAL_AXIOMS_2026-06-29.md:35-41,87-95` | classifies the blocking origin as a representation convention rather than physical structure | construct exact transition data |
| registered foundation node | approved `minimal_axioms`, `docs/audit/data/axiom_premise_nodes.json` | chain-satisfies the translation premise without bounded status | supplies no Hodge, differential, action, or dynamics |
| global transported frame | current runner `D` | closes degree, nilpotence, Hodge degree, and same-action covariance under supplied transitions | uniformly local varying-frame connection |
| all-anchor overlap coframe | current runner `F` | closes positive origin-free one-mode Hodge geometry | signed-shift, degree, Ward, and same-action descent |
| local connection/descent | live downstream construction target | could close `W2` by changing from averaging to transition data | prove finite range, covariance, and action pullback |
| constant metric plus ADM parity | current runner `H` | closes normalized Clifford shell, determinant positivity, and reflection parity | nonuniform history link and common OS Gram |

The registry scan found no approved primitive that needs adding or amending for
these representation/action tasks. This note does not say “no retained
primitive supplies this,” so the separate primitive-absence gate is not
invoked. Frame gauge is a convention; overlap, connection, and temporal-link
choices are downstream action constructions. No axiom amendment is justified.

### N7 — Steelman

**Hostile reviewer:** Your broad obstruction is already broken. An onsite
tensor need not remain onsite in every overlapping chart: the nonzero
interblock entries may be precisely the discrete connection. Runner `D`
shows that conjugating the entire complex preserves every algebraic identity,
and runner `F` constructs an origin-free positive one-mode coframe Gram. The
concrete remaining mechanism is a local dual `L_g` for the redundant analysis
map and `d_ext=E_g d L_g`; its terminal obligations are `L_g E_g=I`, uniform
finite-range support, signed-shift covariance, and the exact `Q_E` action
pullback. A generic Moore–Penrose inverse is not enough because it can be
dense, but a bounded local dual would defeat every broad descent no-go. This
is why only the finite `W1/W2` statements survive and why the next cycle must
attempt that construction.

### N8 — Cross-Cycle Echo

The mandated repository phrase scan and all 89 `NO_GO_LEDGER.md` files were
searched. The exact same residual did not occur earlier; the closest repaired
shapes are:

| earlier wall (exact source) | later repair mechanism | discipline applied here |
|---|---|---|
| Block 103 radius-one Cartan support, `docs/ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_COCHAIN_HODGE_QUADRATIC_WARD_SHELL_LOCALITY_OS_REENTRY_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md:582-587` | the same parent identifies radius-two connection/contact terms rather than an ontology failure | treat bounded interblock support as candidate connection data and test the local dual |
| Block 104 supplied-Gram/origin boundary, `docs/ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_WICK_PHASE_FINE_SITE_STAGGERED_OS_LORENTZ_BOUNDARY_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md:593-603` | same-action residue and an explicit shifted-origin test replace analogy | require the overlap differential and ADM seam to come from the same action |
| Block 104 finite-spacing Lorentz mismatch, `docs/ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_WICK_PHASE_FINE_SITE_STAGGERED_OS_LORENTZ_BOUNDARY_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md:575-583` | several changed-discretization completions remain live | never promote one failed averaging/discretization route to a universal no-go |

**No-Go Discipline verdict:** **PASS** only for finite-witness `W1` and
Reynolds-averaging `W2` inside their fixed premises. **FAIL** for blocking
generally, overlap/coframe geometry, Dirac–Kähler matter, gravity, axiom
necessity, or TOE no-go.

## 11. Axiom And TOE Disposition

The Lattice axiom already says no site is privileged and the admissibility
rule is translation covariant. The fixed physical blocking-origin reading is
therefore not acceptable, but two downstream repairs survive. No axiom
amendment is justified. The necessary update is to the candidate
geometry/action interface: treat origin as a frame gauge and permit bounded
interblock transition data, or prove the stronger overlap-carrier descent.

This is real route progress because it replaces a vague nonuniform-H risk
with one exact failure, one minimal exact repair, and one stronger positive
coframe candidate. It is not retained science and retires no end-to-end
obligation. TOE accounting remains:

- zero obligation retirement;
- no TOE percentage moves; and
- retained-positive end-to-end theory count remains zero.

## 12. Next Decision

The shortest high-value sequence is:

1. derive the common nilpotent patch/frame differential or its exact
   connection residual;
2. derive the reflection-odd ADM temporal link and seam overlap from
   `Q_E(H)`, rather than prescribing it;
3. test the unnormalized two-history Gram on both spatial eigenlines;
4. only then couple the physical gravity constraint quotient and ask whether
   a retained obligation can move.

If the connection/descent residual cannot be cancelled by the action-derived
contact terms, it identifies a downstream action defect. An axiom question
arises only after all one-mode frame/connection routes fail; the positive
witnesses here prevent that conclusion now.
