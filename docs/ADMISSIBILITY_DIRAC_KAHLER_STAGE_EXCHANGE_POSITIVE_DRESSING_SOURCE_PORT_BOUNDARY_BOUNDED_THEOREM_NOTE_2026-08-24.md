claim_type: bounded_theorem
claim_scope: "On the repaired Block-188 doubled carrier formed from two 16-dimensional antiperiodic frames and its declared 16-dimensional two-slice/two-frame history support, every dressing that preserves the derived global stage exchange leaves any Hermitian dressed history Gram grading-odd, so a nonzero positive-semidefinite full-support form is impossible. One exact reflection-real involutive dressing makes the entire declared history Gram positive definite while changing reflection to stage-preserving; a second exact positive involution has genuinely mixed stage character, neither preserving nor exchanging. Both are algebraic witnesses designed from the restricted propagator rather than selected laws. The pure witness does not commute with the explicitly tested same-frame doubled antiperiodic space/time shifts. Every scalar graph with nonzero parameter produces a nonzero traceless form and therefore is not positive semidefinite, while two exact matrix graph ports are positive definite but grading-mixing and fail equivariance under the inherited diagonal spatial shift with source action U_x restricted to the history support. These are finite-carrier algebraic boundaries and escape witnesses, not selected physical sources, general covariance obstructions, gravity/Record ports, OS reconstruction, axiom amendments, obligation retirement, or TOE percentage movement."

## Exact target and obligation graph

**Target.**  Decide whether the same exact Block-188 doubled action can support
an involutive, reflection-real dressing that keeps the derived stage exchange
and makes the declared history form positive; if not, construct exact positive
escapes and identify precisely what physical condition they lose.

| obligation | disposition | exact evidence |
|---|---|---|
| preserve the repaired Block-188 action and stage grading | closed | equation (2), all residuals zero |
| classify every stage-exchanging dressing on the declared history support | closed negatively at this scope | equations (4)--(6), no coefficient ansatz required |
| exhibit positive reflection-real involutions if positivity itself is possible | closed constructively | equations (8)--(10b), exact pure-stage and mixed-stage factorizations |
| retain the derived stage exchange in those positive witnesses | fails for both displayed witnesses | one preserves the grading; the other has neither pure stage character |
| test the cheapest scalar source-port escape | closed negatively in that class | every graph with `z` nonzero has a nonzero Hermitian traceless form |
| exhibit matrix-valued positive graph ports | closed constructively but not physically | equation (13), both fail one inherited spatial-equivariance test at rank eight |
| derive a conserved gravity source and Record-readable port | open | this `d=2` fixture has no TT coordinates; the terminal test requires the genuine four-dimensional lift |

The theorem is bounded to the exact Block-188 full-orbit section fixture, its
16-dimensional AP quotient, the displayed primal/dual-adjoint doublet, and the
history support consisting of the first two AP time slices in both frames.
Different reflection-closed section points, supports, carriers, stage
representations, gravity quotients, or Record maps are not silently included.

The three load-bearing objects are machine-gated literally:
`K=S Qcal^-1`, `Gamma=diag(I_16,-I_16)`, and
`E_N selects {0,...,7} in each frame`.  Thus `E_N` has 16 columns, and the
restricted grading is `E=E_N^dagger Gamma E_N=diag(I_8,-I_8)`.

## Result first

The raw-positivity question is now decided, but the physical-source question
is not.  Positivity exists on the same finite action.  What cannot coexist on
the declared grading-invariant history support is **nonzero positivity and the
already-derived global stage exchange**.

Use the repaired Block-188 objects

\[
 \mathcal Q=\operatorname{diag}(Q,Q^{\vee\dagger}),\qquad
 \mathcal S=\begin{pmatrix}0&R_{\rm AP}^T\\R_{\rm AP}&0\end{pmatrix},
 \qquad
 \Gamma=\operatorname{diag}(I_{16},-I_{16}).        \tag{1}
\]

Exactly,

\[
 \mathcal S^2=I,\qquad
 \mathcal S\Gamma\mathcal S=-\Gamma,\qquad
 [\Gamma,\mathcal Q]=0.                             \tag{2}
\]

The undressed reflected kernel and its declared history restriction are

\[
 K=\mathcal S\mathcal Q^{-1},\qquad
 C=E_N^\dagger K E_N
   =\begin{pmatrix}0&Z\\Z^\dagger&0\end{pmatrix}, \tag{3}
\]

where `K=K^dagger`, `Gamma K Gamma=-K`, and the exact `8x8`
block `Z` is invertible.  Hence `C` is Hermitian, nonsingular, and has
balanced inertia `(8,8,0)`.

As a non-load-bearing changed-frame control, the runner independently rebuilds
PR #7350's named minimal closed frame `H_min=(H+U_x^T H U_x)/2` without
importing that branch.  It is genuinely different from the full-orbit fixture:
the Hodge difference has 96 nonzero entries and rank 32, the cover actions
differ at 256 entries, and the AP actions differ at 128 entries.  Nevertheless
its doubled kernel is again exactly Hermitian and grading-odd, with history
rank 16 and off-diagonal-block rank eight.  Thus the grading mechanism survives
two distinct displayed closed frames; this is not a theorem over the whole
16-member family.

For an arbitrary dressing `A`, the anti-linear reflection has linear part
`Theta_A=A S`.  The derived global stage exchange is equivalent to

\[
 \{A\mathcal S,\Gamma\}=0
 \quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad [A,\Gamma]=0,        \tag{4}
\]

because

\[
 \{A\mathcal S,\Gamma\}=(\Gamma A-A\Gamma)\mathcal S. \tag{5}
\]

If (4) holds, the dressed history form

\[
 C_A=E_N^\dagger A K E_N
\]

obeys

\[
 E C_A E=-C_A.                                     \tag{6}
\]

Therefore every Hermitian `C_A` has sign-paired nonzero spectrum.  If it
were positive semidefinite, (6) would give `tr(C_A)=0`; a positive-semidefinite
Hermitian matrix with zero trace is zero.  A nonzero positive-semidefinite
form, and therefore a positive-definite form, is impossible in this exact
stage-exchanging/full-declared-support class.  This conclusion is stronger
than an empty coefficient search: it does not assume a dressing ansatz or even
use the involution equation.

That is not a positivity no-go for the action.  Let

\[
 W=(E_N,\mathcal S E_N),\qquad
 X_Z=\begin{pmatrix}0&(Z^\dagger)^{-1}\\Z^\dagger&0\end{pmatrix},
\]

and define the displayed dressing

\[
 A_Z=W\operatorname{diag}(X_Z,\overline{X_Z})W^T.  \tag{7}
\]

The exact identities are

\[
 A_Z^2=I,\qquad
 \mathcal S\overline{A_Z}\mathcal S=A_Z,\qquad
 \{A_Z,\Gamma\}=0.                                 \tag{8}
\]

Thus the anti-linear reflection with linear part `Theta_Z=A_Z S` is an
involution, but that linear part **commutes** with `Gamma`: it preserves the
two frame stages instead of exchanging them.  Its declared history form is

\[
 E_N^\dagger A_Z K E_N
 =\operatorname{diag}(I_8,Z^\dagger Z)>0.           \tag{9}
\]

Positivity in (9) is exact: `Z` is invertible, so
`v^dagger Z^dagger Z v = ||Z v||^2 > 0` for every nonzero `v`.

Stage preservation is not the only positive escape.  For real
`a>|b|` with `a^2-b^2=1`, define

\[
 Y_{a,b}=\begin{pmatrix}
 -ibI_8&a(Z^\dagger)^{-1}\\
 aZ^\dagger&ibI_8
 \end{pmatrix},\qquad
 A_{a,b}=W\operatorname{diag}(Y_{a,b},\overline{Y_{a,b}})W^T. \tag{9a}
\]

This dressing obeys
`A_(a,b)^2=I`, `S overline(A_(a,b)) S=A_(a,b)`, and its anti-linear
reflection is involutive.  Its declared history form factors exactly as

\[
 E_N^\dagger A_{a,b}K E_N
 =\operatorname{diag}(I_8,Z^\dagger)
 \begin{pmatrix}aI_8&-ibI_8\\ibI_8&aI_8\end{pmatrix}
 \operatorname{diag}(I_8,Z)>0.                    \tag{9b}
\]

The middle matrix has positive eigenvalues `a+b` and `a-b`, each eightfold.
The runner gates the exact rational member `a=5/3`, `b=4/3`, whose eigenvalues
are `3` and `1/3`.  At that member, all four exact stage-character tests are mixed:
`rank[A_(a,b),Gamma]=rank{A_(a,b),Gamma}=32`, and the commutator and
anticommutator of `A_(a,b) S` with `Gamma` also both have rank 32.  Thus this
positive reflection neither exchanges nor preserves the declared stages.
The pure stage-preserving `A_Z` is the `a=1,b=0` endpoint of the same
algebraic form.  Neither construction is action-selected.

The pure stage-preserving witness also fails the explicitly tested same-frame
doubled AP spatial and temporal commutator tests:

\[
 \operatorname{rank}[A_Z,U_x^{\oplus2}]=32,\quad
 \#\operatorname{supp}=192;\qquad
 \operatorname{rank}[A_Z,U_t^{\oplus2}]=32,\quad
 \#\operatorname{supp}=272.                        \tag{10}
\]

Here `U_mu^(oplus 2)=diag(U_mu,AP,U_mu,AP)`.  These fixed-chart shifts are not
symmetries of the load-bearing action itself: the AP action commutators have
`(rank,support)=(16,160)` spatially and `(16,96)` temporally.  Equation (10)
therefore diagnoses failure of one naive same-frame intertwiner; it is not a
general covariance obstruction.

Equations (7)--(9b) prove that raw positivity is not the wall.  They are
algebraic escape witnesses designed from the observed propagator block `Z`,
not action-selected laws.

## Scalar and matrix graph ports

The cheapest non-grading-invariant source compression is a scalar graph

\[
 V_z=\binom{I_8}{zI_8},\qquad z=a+ib,\quad a,b\in\mathbb R.
\]

Its compressed form is

\[
 V_z^\dagger C V_z
 =a(Z+Z^\dagger)+ib(Z-Z^\dagger).                  \tag{11}
\]

The two Hermitian coefficient matrices in (11) both have exact trace zero,
both have rank eight, and their vectorizations have rank two.  Consequently
every nonzero scalar pair `(a,b)` gives a nonzero traceless Hermitian matrix.
No such matrix is positive semidefinite.  Scalar stage mixing cannot supply a
nonzero positive port on this fixture.  At `z=0` the compression is exactly
zero, hence positive semidefinite but neither nonzero nor positive definite.

Matrix-valued graphs do escape:

\[
 V_+=\binom{(Z^\dagger)^{-1}}{I_8},\qquad
 V_\times=\binom{Z}{I_8},                           \tag{12}
\]

with

\[
 V_+^\dagger C V_+=2I_8,\qquad
 V_\times^\dagger C V_\times=2Z^\dagger Z>0.       \tag{13}
\]

Both graphs mix the grading maximally:
`rank(V,E V)=16`.  Under the inherited diagonal spatial shift, with source
action `U_x` restricted to the history support, each equivariance residual
has rank eight and 48 nonzero entries.  Equations (12)--(13) are therefore
positive algebraic compressions, not source maps equivariant under that
specific inherited action.  They do not exclude a shifted-chart, dual-typed,
paired-port, or transformed covariance law.  They show exactly what the next
physical construction must add.

## Authority, prior art, and the new pincer

The calculation freezes `origin/main` at
`c79384cb8ffa27fcb53cb89c53a84a708442eaad` and stacks on the independently
repaired Block 188 at `a4c36311dc393e17649cec581cd609650d5ab27e`.

- [Block 188](ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_DUAL_FRAME_TEMPORAL_LINK_STAGE_INTERTWINER_BOUNDARY_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-24.md)
  supplies the doubled action, reflection, stage grading, and declared history
  support.  This block changes none of them.
- Block 114 already proves that a positive reflection-real involutive dressing
  exists on its different `32x32` eight-slice torus.  Its propagator,
  reflection, and restriction differ, so its `33/32` precursor ranks are
  controls rather than evidence here.
- Branch-local PR #7350 independently derives an invertible temporal
  transporter and exact seam parity on the **minimal** reflection-closed frame
  over PR #7347.  This block uses the Block-188 **full-orbit** frame and imports
  no #7350 result.  Its transporter is the best cheap first gate for the next
  integrated campaign: put a seam/two-slice-Schur port on a common frame and
  test its reflection, equivariance, and positivity before entering the
  genuine four-dimensional source/Record solve.
- The runner independently reconstructs the minimal-frame raw doubled kernel
  at mass `2/7` and confirms the same Hermitian grading-odd rank pattern, but
  imports none of #7350's link, pole, or seam numbers as Block-188 facts.

The novelty is an exact bounded classification with constructive
counterroutes on the Block-188 action: stage-exchanging full-support forms are
grading-odd; positive full-support involutions exist with both pure
stage-preserving and genuinely mixed stage character; scalar graph ports are
excluded at nonzero parameter; and two matrix graph ports are positive while
failing the declared inherited spatial-equivariance test.  No exhaustiveness
claim is made over mixed-grade dressings or transformed covariance diagrams.

## No-Go Discipline Gate

The broad statements “the action cannot be positive,” “gravity fails,” or “no
physical source exists” fail this gate and are not shipped.  The only negative
claims are the algebraic statements in equations (4)--(6) and (11), each
bounded to a declared representation, support, and port class.

### N1 — Alternative route enumeration

| normalized route | status | exact result against the narrow claims |
|---|---|---|
| stage-exchanging full declared support | ATTEMPTED | equation (6) forces every Hermitian form to be grading-odd |
| parity-odd dressing | ATTEMPTED | equation (9) is positive, but reflection becomes stage-preserving |
| mixed-grade dressing | ATTEMPTED | equation (9b) is positive; both pure stage-character tests have rank 32 |
| scalar graph compression | ATTEMPTED | every graph with `z` nonzero has a nonzero traceless form |
| matrix graph compression | ATTEMPTED | two exact positive ports exist; both mix grading and fail the inherited diagonal spatial-equivariance test |
| positive spectral half | NOT ADMISSIBLE AS EVIDENCE | it would select the port after observing the spectrum |
| Block-114 positive chart | ATTEMPTED AS CONTROL | different carrier, reflection, propagator, and support |
| #7350 minimal-frame grading control | ATTEMPTED | independently rebuilt raw kernel has the same Hermitian grading-odd ranks |
| #7350 seam-derived port | UNTESTED LIVE ROUTE | action-derived transporter exists on that different frame, but the committed Gram remains open |
| changed carrier or stage representation | UNTESTED LIVE ROUTE | outside the theorem's quantifiers |

These routes change the stage character, primary representation, port
mechanism, or terminal obligation.  The exact mixed-grade witness and the live
seam/changed-carrier routes defeat any pure-stage dichotomy or family-wide
negative conclusion.

### N2 — Wall-independence audit

| pair | first closes second? | second closes first? | disposition |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| stage exchange / positivity | no | no | their intersection is empty only on the declared grading-invariant support |
| positivity / tested same-frame shift commutator | no | no | (9) is positive and its witness fails both displayed commutators |
| tested same-frame shift equivariance / gravity-source rank | no | no | distinct representation and physical-interface obligations |
| gravity-source rank / Record readability | no | no | a conserved source need not be a registered permanent Record |

No downstream wall is used as support for the algebraic exclusions.

### N3 — Hidden-wall scan

The load-bearing fixtures are the exact repaired Block-188 full-orbit action,
`K=S Qcal^-1`, `Gamma=diag(I_16,-I_16)`, and
`E_N selects {0,...,7} in each frame`.  The graph ports, shift convention, and
the distinction between linear and anti-linear reflection are explicit.
“Positive” means positive definite only for the exact restricted Hermitian
forms in (9), (9b), and (13); it does not mean OS reconstruction.  The tested
fixed-chart shifts are not symmetries of the action itself, so their residuals
are not a general covariance obstruction.  “Action-adapted” means
algebraically built from `Z`, not selected by an independent law.

### N4 — Residual matching

| prior item | its residual | present residual | match / use |
|---|---|---|---|
| Block 188 (`docs/ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_DUAL_FRAME_TEMPORAL_LINK_STAGE_INTERTWINER_BOUNDARY_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-24.md:349-367`) | balanced raw doubled Gram and open positive source port | compatible dressing/source-port intersection | exact parent target |
| Block 114 (`docs/ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_POSITIVE_DRESSED_REFLECTION_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-15.md:492-500`) | positive involution on another propagator | stage character on Block-188 action | no; constructive control only |
| Block 187 (`docs/ADMISSIBILITY_COMMON_ACTION_STATIONARITY_GRAVITY_STAGE_ORIENTATION_BOUNDARY_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-24.md:70-90`) | reversal-odd stage carrier unselected | exact doubled stage character | yes as typing target, not as negative evidence |
| PR #7350 (`docs/ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_TEMPORAL_LINK_EXTRACTION_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-24.md:641-647` on its branch) | invertible seam transporter, two-history Gram open | covariant physical port | live pincer on a different frame, not imported evidence |

No prior no-go with mismatched walls is used.

### N5 — Rhetoric and resolution audit

per_element: checked the exact doubled reflection, action, grading, dressings, and Gram entries.

per_site: checked the declared two-slice AP history support in both frames and both graph ports.

per_mode: checked the full stage-grading pair and the eight-dimensional graph-port fibers exactly.

per_block: checked the raw off-diagonal block, the positive factorization, and both shift commutators exactly.

lattice_wide: checked and not executed — no width ladder, long-history OS reconstruction, gravity quotient, or Record write is claimed.

No unchecked resolution is negated.  In particular, the result is not a
long-history, four-dimensional, gravity, Record, or refinement theorem.

### N6 — Partial-closure paths

The mixed-grade family is an executed same-carrier escape, not a live physical
law.  Five non-axiom construction routes remain live: transport #7350's seam
port to the same reflection-closed frame while retaining the distance-two
bands; derive a stage-paired pair of non-grading-invariant ports rather than
demanding one invariant port; derive a covariance diagram and dressing from
the action instead of designing `A_Z` or `A_(a,b)` from the Gram; lift the
surviving construction into the genuine four-dimensional common action; or
change the periodic/massless carrier.  Each requires a new bounded theorem
and, where imported, an import-retirement audit.  This block does not claim
that an axiom amendment is required and does not edit the minimal axioms or
primitive registry.

### N7 — Steelman

A hostile reviewer should reject any physical no-go.  Equations (9), (9b),
and (13) already prove that the fixed action admits positive algebraic forms.
The failure is simultaneous typing under the tested actions: one full-support
witness preserves stages and fails the displayed same-frame shift
commutators, while another has unselected mixed stage character; the graph
witnesses mix stages and fail one inherited diagonal spatial-equivariance
test.  A seam-derived
pair of ports could transform into one another under reflection, remain
covariant as a pair, and carry a positive Gram on each physical source fiber.
PR #7350 now supplies an action-derived invertible
transporter from which such a port might be built.  Until that common-frame
intersection is tested, gravity and Record closure remain live.

### N8 — Cross-cycle echo

Block 114 showed that enlarging the dressing support can turn an apparent
positivity obstruction into a positive witness.  Block 187 showed that
retyping a Hessian demand as a source vertex can remove an artificial gravity
wall.  This block repeats both lessons constructively: positivity returns for
both a pure-preserving and a mixed stage character, and positive graph ports
return when the support stops being grading invariant.  Those escapes are
measured rather than dismissed, which is why the conclusion stops at the
precise intersections above.

No-go-discipline status: `PASS` for the stage-exchanging/full-declared-support
and nonzero-parameter scalar-graph exclusions; `FAIL` for any action-wide, source-wide, gravity,
Record, or TOE no-go, none of which is claimed.

## Assumptions, imports, and open interfaces

| item | status |
|---|---|
| repaired Block-188 doubled action and reflection | exact pinned input |
| full-orbit section point and mass `2/7` | explicit fixture, not selected law |
| first two AP time slices in both frames | explicit history restriction |
| frame grading as Block-187 stage representation | derived candidate carried by Block 188 |
| displayed `A_Z`, `A_(a,b)`, and graph ports | exact constructed witnesses, not selected laws |
| common-frame #7350 seam/two-slice-Schur port | open capped kill gate |
| total Ward/recoil and four-dimensional gravity quotient | open |
| physical source and Record-readable rank | open |
| propagating TT gravity on this `d=2` fixture | unavailable; the four-dimensional lift is required |
| long-history OS reconstruction and refinement | open |
| probability, clock, permanent write, nonlinear law | open |

Accordingly, no physical source or Record-readable rank is claimed by this
block.  This is not a gravity failure, and it does not edit the minimal axioms
or primitive registry.

## Reproduction

```bash
python3 scripts/admissibility_dirac_kahler_stage_exchange_positive_dressing_source_port_boundary_2026_08_24.py
python3 scripts/admissibility_dirac_kahler_stage_exchange_positive_dressing_source_port_boundary_2026_08_24.py --list-mutations
python3 scripts/admissibility_dirac_kahler_stage_exchange_positive_dressing_source_port_boundary_2026_08_24.py --mutation claim_scalar_port_positive
```

The baseline must end `TOTAL: PASS=7 FAIL=0`.  Each of the eleven mutations must
end `TOTAL: PASS=6 FAIL=1` with only its mapped gate down.

## Review record

The block drops four tempting stronger claims.  It does not say the action is
nonpositive, because (9), (9b), and (13) are exact positive witnesses.  It
does not impose a pure stage-character dichotomy, because (9b) is an exact
mixed-stage counterexample.  It does not say a physical source exists, because
every displayed witness is engineered from `Z` and fails a declared stage or
equivariance test.  It does not transport the Block-114 precursor ranks or PR
#7350 seam result across mismatched actions.

Hard landing conditions are a fresh repaired-parent pin, literal audit inputs,
canonical cache, eleven isolated mutations, the complete N1--N8 record, and
repository conformance.  No review-loop or audit verdict is part of this
package.

## TOE disposition and next decisive campaign

This is significant route progress but not TOE score progress.  The fixed
action's raw positivity wall is gone; exact positive witnesses now cover one
pure-preserving and one genuinely mixed stage character, while the
stage-exchanging class remains excluded.  Mixed-grade reflections and
differently typed paired ports remain open beyond those witnesses.  The
retained-positive end-to-end theory count remains zero.  Zero obligations
retire, no TOE percentage changes, and no axiom amendment is justified.

The highest-leverage successor is an integrated vertical slice, not a
standalone seam campaign.  First use PR #7350 as a capped common-frame kill
gate: rebuild its transporter on the Block-188 full-orbit frame, account for
the live distance-two bands with an exact two-slice/supercell Schur
construction, preregister the reflection-paired port before inspecting its
Gram, and test reflection character, inherited spatial equivariance,
Hermiticity, and positivity.  Then move immediately to Block 187's genuine
four-dimensional finite-Laurent common-action solve for the nonlinear DK
vertex, total Ward/recoil, TT-source rank, and Record-readable rank.  The
reason for that lift is already exact: the
[constraint-quotient result](ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_CONSTRAINT_QUOTIENT_COUPLING_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-16.md)
gives this `d=2` symmetric-perturbation fixture zero TT coordinates.  A seam
pass here unlocks the four-dimensional test; it cannot itself retire a gravity
obligation.  Do not run another unconstrained dressing search.
