claim_scope: "For flat Euclidean H=I, inside the constant relative-phase family D_phi=mI+exp(i phi)M_0, requiring the squared norm D_phi^dagger D_phi to be the scalar covariance m^2+s^2 selects phi=+/-pi/2; every D_phi is normal, so normality is not the selector. The +i extension Q_E(H)=mH+i[Hd+d^dagger H] obeys the same Cartan-Hodge Ward identity and is degree-phase equivalent for degree-preserving H to the skew Kahler-Dirac kernel mH+Hd-d^dagger H. On an even flat fine lattice, the explicit 2^d-cell placement Psi_A(N)=chi_(2N+A), Q=2q, subcell phase P, and pairwise-Koszul phase S prove exact unitary equivalence to one staggered Grassmann field for d=2 and d=4. The reflected Gram is derived from the inside-pole residue and an independent open-chain inverse of that same action: the d=2 reduced cell has two spatial eigenlines, corresponding to the two continuum staggered tastes, and a 4x4 rank-two Gram; the d=4 spatial cell has eight eigenlines and a 16x16 rank-eight Gram. Nonzero massless modes remain positive, while the simultaneous massless zero mode has path-dependent support and needs a prescription. Euclidean and Lorentz determinant polynomials are exact analytic continuations, but the finite-spacing OS energy asinh(r) is not the central-time Lorentz frequency asin(r). Curved-history positivity, blocking-origin covariance for nonuniform H, the actual ADM/history transporter, joint gravity, exact finite-spacing Lorentz reconstruction, energy, Records, retention, axiom amendment, obligation retirement, and TOE percentage movement are not claimed."

## 1. Result Up Front

[Block 103](ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_COCHAIN_HODGE_QUADRATIC_WARD_SHELL_LOCALITY_OS_REENTRY_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md)
constructed a degree-closed Hodge carrier but correctly stopped short of
reflection positivity for its own action. Its Hermitian flat Euclidean
operator is

\[
 M_0=\sum_\mu \Gamma_\mu\sin k_\mu,
 \qquad M_0^\dagger=M_0,
 \qquad M_0^2=s^2I.                              \tag{1}
\]

The naive massive kernel `D_bad=mI+M0` is not the massive Euclidean fermion
kernel used by the reflected-Gram theorem. Exactly,

\[
 \det D_{\rm bad}=(m^2-s^2)^{2^{d-1}},           \tag{2}
\]

and, when the mass lies in the lattice momentum band, it can become singular
at real momentum; (10) is an exact witness. The correct candidate inside the
constant relative-phase family is

\[
 Q_E(H)=mH+i\bigl(Hd+d^\dagger H\bigr).          \tag{3}
\]

This phase is not fitted. For

\[
 D_\phi=mI+e^{i\phi}M_0,
\]

requiring the squared norm to equal the scalar covariance gives

\[
 D_\phi^\dagger D_\phi
 =(m^2+s^2)I+2m\cos\phi\,M_0.                   \tag{4}
\]

Every `D_phi` is normal because it is a polynomial in Hermitian `M0`; normality
alone selects nothing.  For nonzero mass and momentum, scalar squared norm in
(4) forces `phi=+/-pi/2`. The independent antiunitary time-pullback covariance
condition selects the same two phases. The signs are the two time
orientations; `+i` matches the forward-time convention of the source action.

Equation (3) keeps the gravity progress. The mass and kinetic pieces obey the
same exact Cartan–Hodge Ward law. Moreover, for every degree-preserving Hodge
operator, the degree phase `Q_N|Lambda^p>=i^p|Lambda^p>` gives

\[
 Q_N^\dagger Q_E(H)Q_N=mH+Hd-d^\dagger H.       \tag{5}
\]

Thus (3) is exactly the skew Kähler–Dirac Euclidean action in a form-phase
basis, not a new fitted stencil.

The fine-site bridge is also exact. In dimension `d`, the `2^d` exterior
components occupy the `2^d` offsets of one even fine hypercube,

\[
 \Psi_A(N)=\chi_{2N+A},\qquad A\in\{0,1\}^d.    \tag{6}
\]

An explicit momentum-placement phase and one fixed Koszul phase map the raw
blocked staggered kernel to (3). For `d=4`, the sixteen exterior components
occupy the sixteen fine sites of one `2^4` cell—eight spatial sites across two
time slices—with one Grassmann mode per fine site. There is no co-located
four-copy overcount.

Consequently the July free reflected Gram is now a **same-action reflected
Gram** on the flat carrier. In `d=2`, the two reduced-cell spatial eigenlines
(the two continuum staggered tastes) give a `4x4` Gram of rank two. In `d=4`,
the eight spatial eigenlines give a `16x16` Gram of rank eight. This closes the flat free carrier-placement
and positive-time unbarred OS bridge, not curved-history or joint-gravity
positivity.

The remaining time issue is sharply localized. With

\[
 r^2=m^2+\sum_j\sin^2q_j,
\]

OS transfer gives `sinh E=r`, while the original central-time Lorentz shell
gives `sin omega=r`. The determinant polynomials are analytic continuations,
but

\[
 \omega-E={r^3\over3}+O(r^7).                   \tag{7}
\]

Therefore this is not an exact finite-spacing Lorentz reconstruction. The
next gravity gate is blocking-origin covariance for nonuniform Hodge data and
then the actual ADM/history transporter, not another generic Gram theorem.

## 2. Authority And Exact Contract

Current axiom authority is
[MINIMAL_AXIOMS_2026-06-29.md](MINIMAL_AXIOMS_2026-06-29.md) at
`origin/main 43ba5587944ffe0f43df10864c8348a99c17517b`, with axiom blob
`bc23300becfe4e4db57153c0e94cfcdf2338da71`.

The exact stacked parent is Block 103 commit
`99cee0a6c962b382a3ca1a8497d589ffa280dfe8`. The runner content-binds its note,
runner, and cache. The reflected-Gram input is
[Free Staggered 3+1 Reflected-Gram / CAR-Fock Representation](FREE_STAGGERED_3PLUS1_REFLECTED_GRAM_CAR_FOCK_REPRESENTATION_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-07-12.md),
whose current-main note/runner/cache blobs are separately bound. Neither
dependency contributes an imported audit verdict.

The executed contract is:

1. the constant relative-phase family `D_phi` in (4);
2. a degree-preserving Hodge operator for (5) and the Ward identity;
3. flat Euclidean `H=I` for the fine-site and reflected-Gram theorems;
4. even fine extents and one declared `2^d` blocking origin;
5. reduced Bloch momentum `Q=2q`;
6. `d=2` and `d=4`, with time first in the canonical subset ordering;
7. the source theorem's free CAR/Grassmann branch, infinite vacuum time, and
   positive-time unbarred OS algebra;
8. nonzero `m` for uniform invertibility, plus separately controlled nonzero
   massless spatial modes; and
9. a polynomial Euclidean/Lorentz comparison, not a reconstruction theorem.

## 3. Phase Selection And The Naive Kernel Boundary

In the Block 103 two-plane basis,

\[
 \Gamma_x=i(E_x-I_x),\qquad \Gamma_t=i(E_t-I_t), \tag{8}
\]

with

\[
 \Gamma_\mu^\dagger=\Gamma_\mu,\quad
 \Gamma_\mu^2=I,\quad
 \{\Gamma_x,\Gamma_t\}=0.                       \tag{9}
\]

Thus `M0^2=(s_x^2+s_t^2)I`. Equations (2) and (4) follow without an inverse.
At the exact witness

\[
 m={1\over2},\qquad s_x=0,\qquad s_t={1\over2}, \tag{10}
\]

`D_bad` is singular, whereas

\[
 \det(mI+iM_0)=(m^2+s_x^2+s_t^2)^2={1\over4}.   \tag{11}
\]

No invertible fine-site unitary can repair a rank mismatch. More generally,
the singular values of `D_bad` are `|m+s|,|m-s|`, each twice, while (3) has
the scalar singular value `sqrt(m^2+s^2)`. Within the declared **flat**
constant-phase family, scalar squared norm forces `cos phi=0`;
`phi=+/-pi/2` is exhaustive up to time orientation. This does not assert that
`Q_E(H)^dag Q_E(H)` is scalar for generic curved `H`; the curved extension is
selected here by the Ward and degree-phase identities, not by (4).

Two distinct objects give the same flat selection.  With
`P_t=Z tensor I`, direct antiunitary time pullback gives

\[
 P_tD_\phi(s_x,-s_t)^*P_t=D_\phi(s_x,s_t)
 \quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
 -e^{-i\phi}=e^{i\phi}.                         \tag{11a}
\]

At the zero-spatial, `m=1/2` recurrence, the naive phase instead has the
two-step matrix

\[
 \begin{pmatrix}-i&1\\1&0\end{pmatrix}^{\!2}
 =\begin{pmatrix}0&-i\\-i&1\end{pmatrix},       \tag{11b}
\]

which is not Hermitian, whereas the staggered source recurrence has the
positive two-step form `B^dagger B`.  The runner executes both (11a) and
(11b); they are not restatements of the determinant witness.

This is a narrow flat-action boundary. It does not say every Hermitian response
operator fails, nor that the Block 103 Hodge Hessian is wrong. It says only
that the flat `mI+M0` member is not the massive Euclidean kernel of the July
source theorem; consequently that source theorem cannot justify the generic
`mH+M(H)` family without a different bridge.

## 4. Same Hodge Action And Exact Ward Identity

For incoming and outgoing differentials, define as in Block 103

\[
 D=d_{\rm out}\iota_\xi+\iota_\xi d_{\rm in},
 \qquad
 D_{\rm rev}=d_{\rm in}\iota_\xi+\iota_\xi d_{\rm out}, \tag{12}
\]

and

\[
 R_H=-D_{\rm rev}^\dagger H-HD.                 \tag{13}
\]

The mass term obeys

\[
 mR_H+mD_{\rm rev}^\dagger H+mHD=0.             \tag{14}
\]

Block 103's kinetic identity gives

\[
 V(R_H)+D_{\rm rev}^\dagger M_{\rm in}
 +M_{\rm out}D=0.                               \tag{15}
\]

Multiplying (15) by `i` and adding (14) proves

\[
 \bigl(mR_H+iV(R_H)\bigr)
 +D_{\rm rev}^\dagger Q_{E,{\rm in}}
 +Q_{E,{\rm out}}D=0.                           \tag{16}
\]

The runner checks (16) for both Block 103 signatures and both contraction
directions. The Euclidean OS theorem below uses `epsilon=+1`; replaying the
algebra at `epsilon=-1` is not a massive Lorentz reconstruction.

For the degree phase

\[
 Q_N=\operatorname{diag}(1,i,i,-1)              \tag{17}
\]

in two dimensions, degree preservation gives `[Q_N,H]=0`, while raising and
lowering degree give

\[
 Q_N^\dagger dQ_N=-i\,d,\qquad
 Q_N^\dagger d^\dagger Q_N=+i\,d^\dagger.      \tag{18}
\]

Equation (5) follows. The same proof holds in all dimensions.

## 5. Exact Fine-Site Equivalence In `d=2` And `d=4`

Order the axes with time first. On one fine-axis two-site cell define

\[
 h(Q)=\begin{pmatrix}
 0&(1-e^{-iQ})/2\\
 (e^{iQ}-1)/2&0
 \end{pmatrix}.                                  \tag{19}
\]

The standard temporal-gauge staggered phases produce

\[
 D_{\rm stag}(Q)=mI+
 \sum_{\mu=0}^{d-1}
 Z^{\otimes\mu}\otimes h(Q_\mu)
 \otimes I^{\otimes(d-\mu-1)}.                  \tag{20}
\]

Let

\[
 Q_\mu=2q_\mu,
 \qquad
 P_\mu=\operatorname{diag}(e^{-iq_\mu/2},e^{iq_\mu/2}),
 \qquad P=\bigotimes_\mu P_\mu.                \tag{21}
\]

Exactly,

\[
 P_\mu^\dagger h(2q_\mu)P_\mu=i\sin q_\mu X. \tag{22}
\]

Define

\[
 \Gamma_\mu^X=Z^{\otimes\mu}\otimes X
 \otimes I^{\otimes(d-\mu-1)},                 \tag{23}
\]

\[
 \Gamma_\mu^{\rm DK}=I^{\otimes\mu}\otimes Y
 \otimes Z^{\otimes(d-\mu-1)}.                 \tag{24}
\]

The second set is the exterior/Koszul representation
`i(E_mu-E_mu^dagger)` in the Block-103-compatible time-first bit ordering.  If
`A` is a fine-cell bit string and `|A|` its degree, define the onsite Koszul
phase

\[
 S_A=(-i)^{|A|}(-1)^{|A|(|A|-1)/2},\qquad W=PS. \tag{25}
\]

Equivalently, `S` is the tensor product of `diag(1,-i)` on every bit followed
by a controlled `Z` for every bit pair.  In `d=2`, it is
`diag(1,-i,-i,1)`, so (24) gives
`Gamma_t=Y tensor Z` and `Gamma_x=I tensor Y`, exactly the Block 103 basis.
The pairwise Koszul factor is load-bearing; the bare tensor-product phase
would map to a different Clifford convention and would not prove the stacked
claim.

Then one has

\[
 S^\dagger\Gamma_\mu^XS=\Gamma_\mu^{\rm DK}    \tag{26}
\]

and hence

\[
 W^\dagger D_{\rm stag}(2q)W
 =mI+i\sum_\mu\Gamma_\mu^{\rm DK}\sin q_\mu
 =Q_E(H_0;q).                                    \tag{27}
\]

The phase `P` is the Fourier placement of the offsets in (6); it is not an
extra internal field. The phase `S` is fixed and onsite. Equation (27) proves
one-to-one counting:

- in `d=2`, four form components occupy four fine sites of one `2x2` cell;
- in `d=4`, sixteen exterior components occupy the sixteen fine sites of one
  `2^4` cell; and
- in both cases there is one Grassmann mode per fine site.

The extents must be even for a periodic global cell decomposition. A shifted
blocking origin is exactly equivalent in the flat action by fine translation.
Equivariance of nonuniform `H_site(e)` and its overlapping-cell geometry under
all fine translations remains unexecuted.

## 6. Time Cell, Spatial Lines, And The Same-Action Gram

Diagonalize the real anti-Hermitian spatial hop. On an eigenline `i lambda`,
the two-time-slice cell is

\[
 D_\lambda(\zeta)=
 \begin{pmatrix}
 m+i\lambda&(1-\zeta^{-1})/2\\
 (\zeta-1)/2&m-i\lambda
 \end{pmatrix},                                  \tag{28}
\]

with

\[
 \det D_\lambda
 =m^2+\lambda^2+{2-\zeta-\zeta^{-1}\over4}.     \tag{29}
\]

For

\[
 r=\sqrt{m^2+\lambda^2},\quad
 E=\operatorname{arsinh}r,\quad
 z=e^{-2E},\quad
 b_\lambda={m+i\lambda\over r},                 \tag{30}
\]

the inside pole is `z`, and the determinant factorizes as

\[
 \Delta_\lambda(\zeta)
 =-{(\zeta-z)(\zeta-z^{-1})\over4\zeta}.       \tag{30a}
\]

The cell-separation-one coefficient is not imported as a supplied matrix.
Taking the inside-pole residue of the inverse of the same matrix (28) gives,
in target-parity by source-parity order,

\[
 R_\lambda={1\over z-z^{-1}}
 \begin{pmatrix}
 -4z(m-i\lambda)&2(z-1)\\
 2z(z-1)&-4z(m+i\lambda)
 \end{pmatrix}.                                 \tag{30b}
\]

For `theta(t)=-1-t`, reflected source parity is `1-a`, while target parity is
`b`; therefore the operator-kernel Gram is exactly

\[
 K_{ab}=G(b,\theta a),\qquad
 K_\lambda=XR_\lambda^T
 =\begin{pmatrix}R_{01}&R_{11}\\R_{00}&R_{10}\end{pmatrix}. \tag{30c}
\]

Using `r=(1-z)/(2 sqrt(z))`, (30c) simplifies to

\[
 K_\lambda={2z\over1+z}
 \begin{pmatrix}
 1&\sqrt z\,b_\lambda\\
 \sqrt z\,\bar b_\lambda&z
 \end{pmatrix}
 =A_\lambda^\dagger A_\lambda,                 \tag{31}
\]

\[
 A_\lambda=\sqrt{{2z\over1+z}}
 \begin{pmatrix}1&\sqrt z\,b_\lambda\end{pmatrix}. \tag{32}
\]

Thus `rank K_lambda=1` and its spectrum is `{0,2z}`.

The runner verifies (30a)–(32) exactly at the algebraic fixture
`m=9/20`, `lambda=+/-3/5`, `r=3/4`, `z=1/4`, and separately solves the
open fine-time chain built from
`D(t,t)=m+i(-1)^t lambda`, `D(t,t+1)=1/2`, `D(t,t-1)=-1/2`.  Its central
reflected Gram converges monotonically at half-extents `8,16,24` to (31) for
both signs, with worst final infinity-norm residual below `10^-11`.  Thus the
same-action provenance is checked once by exact residue algebra and again by
a dense inverse of the actual mode operator.

For `d=2`, the spatial two-site cell has `lambda=+/-sin q_x` once each. The
same-action Dirac–Kähler Gram is

\[
 K_{\rm DK}^{(2)}=K_+\oplus K_-,                \tag{33}
\]

a `4x4` matrix of rank two and spectrum `{0,0,2z,2z}`.  These are two
spatial eigenlines, interpreted as the two continuum staggered tastes, rather
than two co-located fine-site copies.

For `d=4`, the eight-dimensional spatial cell has

\[
 \lambda=\pm\sqrt{\sin^2q_1+\sin^2q_2+\sin^2q_3} \tag{34}
\]

with multiplicity four for each sign. These eight spatial eigenlines produce

\[
 K_{\rm DK}^{(4)}=K_+^{\oplus4}\oplus K_-^{\oplus4}, \tag{35}
\]

a `16x16` matrix of rank eight with eight zero and eight `2z` eigenvalues.
This is the direct same-action bridge to the July 3+1 theorem. It is not the
old arbitrary two-copy congruence control in Block 103.

## 7. Induced Dirac–Kähler Reflection

The source reflection is antimultiplicative and uses

\[
 \Theta\chi_{t,x}=-\bar\chi_{-1-t,x}^{\,T}.      \tag{36}
\]

Transporting it through the anti-linear phase map in (25) gives

\[
 -S\Gamma_0^X S^*=\Gamma_0^{\rm DK}.            \tag{37}
\]

The subcell placement phases pair across the reflected seam, leaving

\[
 P_0(q)X P_0(q)=X,
 \qquad P_0(q)=\operatorname{diag}(e^{-iq/2},e^{iq/2}). \tag{37a}
\]

This is `PXP`, not `P^dagger X P`: reflection is anti-linear and sends the
offset `a` to `1-a`.  The remaining common coarse-cell displacement is already
the cell separation in the residue (30b), not an internal component phase.
Thus

\[
 \Theta_{\rm DK}\Psi
 =\Gamma_0^{\rm DK}\bar\Psi_{\theta(t)}^{\,T}.  \tag{38}
\]

The runner checks (37), (37a), and the exact Block 103 orientation in `d=2`
and `d=4`. This time-gamma factor is
load-bearing. A bare componentwise reflection would not be the pullback of the
source OS algebra.

With (27), (31), and (38), every finite positive-time unbarred Wick determinant
covered by the source theorem pulls back unitarily to the flat free
Dirac–Kähler carrier. Barred/contact completion remains the source theorem's
open boundary and is not enlarged here.

## 8. Massless Nonzero Modes And The Zero Mode

For `m=0` and `lambda!=0`, equations (30)–(32) remain defined:

\[
 r=|\lambda|,\qquad b_\lambda=i\operatorname{sign}\lambda, \tag{39}
\]

and `K_lambda` stays positive semidefinite of rank one. Thus there is no broad
massless positivity failure.

At the simultaneous `(m,lambda)=(0,0)` mode, `b_lambda` is undefined and the
covariance has a genuine zero mode. The `m->0+` limit is positive but choosing
that limit is a regulator prescription.  Indeed, `D_0(zeta=1)=0` and the two
approaches

\[
 (m\to0^+,\lambda=0):\quad K\to
 \begin{pmatrix}1&1\\1&1\end{pmatrix},\qquad
 (m=0,\lambda\to0^+):\quad K\to
 \begin{pmatrix}1&i\\-i&1\end{pmatrix}          \tag{39a}
\]

are both positive rank-one matrices but have different support projectors.
The runner executes the double zero and this path dependence. Antiperiodic spatial boundary
conditions, a finite-volume quotient, or an explicit regulator remain live.
The zero-mode prescription remains open.

## 9. Exact Polynomial Wick Link, But Not Exact Finite-Spacing Lorentz Time

For the Euclidean branch,

\[
 \det Q_E=(m^2+s_x^2+s_t^2)^2.                  \tag{40}
\]

For the massive Lorentz polynomial built from the Block 103 Lorentz Hodge,

\[
 Q_L=M_-+imH_-,\qquad
 \det Q_L=(m^2+s_x^2-s_t^2)^2.                  \tag{41}
\]

The substitution `s_t -> i s_t` maps (40) exactly to (41). This is an exact
analytic relation between determinant polynomials.

It does not identify their finite-spacing time parameters. The OS pole obeys

\[
 \sinh^2E=r^2,
\]

whereas the central-time Lorentz shell obeys

\[
 \sin^2\omega=r^2.                              \tag{42}
\]

They agree at leading continuum order, but equation (7) is nonzero for every
generic finite `r`. For `r>1`, the central-time equation has no real principal
frequency while the OS transfer energy remains real. Therefore Block 104 is
not an exact finite-spacing Lorentz reconstruction.

Live completions include a controlled continuum limit, a transfer-derived
Lorentz update with energy `E`, an anisotropic/perfect action, or a separate
clock/continuation theorem. No one of these is selected here.

## 10. Gravity Interface And Axiom Disposition

The flat result closes two kinematic sub-obligations left by Block 103:

1. the `2^d` form components can be distributed one per fine site exactly;
2. the resulting flat free Euclidean action has the source-bound positive
   reflected Gram on that same action.

It does not close the gravity chain. Although (5) and (16) hold for
degree-preserving `H`, curved-history reflected positivity remains unexecuted.
The first risk is blocking-origin covariance: one `2^d` cell origin is harmless
in the flat shift-symmetric action, but a nonuniform Hodge operator can
privilege the even sublattice. The next packet must construct every shifted-
block intertwiner and prove the overlapping-cell geometry is equivariant, or
exhibit the exact failure.

After that, the actual ADM/history transporter remains unexecuted. It must
derive the cross-plane link from the gravity action and make the unnormalized
determinant kernel a common Gram. The positive physical gravity kernel,
constraint reduction, reciprocal recoil, total energy, Record compiler,
selection, adoption, and retention remain open.

The four axioms do not choose the relative Euclidean phase in isolation. Here
`phi=+/-pi/2` is selected inside a declared flat candidate family by scalar
squared norm and the supplied OS orientation. That is a downstream action-law
decision, not an ontology change. No axiom amendment is justified.

## 11. No-Go Discipline Gate

There are two bounded negative statements:

- `W1`: the flat `mI+M0` member is not the massive Euclidean kernel of the
  July source theorem inside the declared constant-phase family; and
- `W2`: `E=asinh r` is not exactly `omega=asin r` for the original central-
  time discretization at finite spacing.

Neither is a broad fermion, Hodge, Euclidean, Lorentz, locality, gravity,
axiom, or TOE no-go.

### N1 — Alternative Route Enumeration

All rows below attack the shipped boundaries inside their exact premises and
are **ATTEMPTED**.  The `family` column is normalized by primary object and
load-bearing invariant; determinant, rank, and singular-value observations
are counted as one spectral family, while series and exact-point comparisons
are counted as one analytic-function family.

| boundary | normalized family | attempted rescue | why it fails inside the fixed premise |
|---|---|---|---|
| `W1` | spectral zero set | identify `D_bad` with the massive source kernel by determinant/rank/singular spectrum | (2), (10), and (11) give an exact zero where the source kernel is invertible; no invertible left/right relabeling repairs rank (`ATTEMPTED`, runner B) |
| `W1` | antiunitary reflection covariance | demand the source time-pullback symmetry directly, without using a determinant | (11a) gives `-exp(-i phi)=exp(i phi)` and rejects `phi=0` (`ATTEMPTED`, runner B) |
| `W1` | real-space recurrence/transfer | seek a positive two-step transfer directly from the naive central recurrence | (11b) is non-Hermitian at the exact witness, while the [July source action](FREE_STAGGERED_3PLUS1_REFLECTED_GRAM_CAR_FOCK_REPRESENTATION_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-07-12.md) gives `B^dag B` (`ATTEMPTED`, runner B) |
| `W1` | fine-cell action equivalence | try to obtain `D_bad` by an onsite/blocking unitary from the one-field staggered action | the explicit `W` in (21)–(27) lands on `mI+iM0`, including the Block 103 orientation, never `D_bad` (`ATTEMPTED`, runner D) |
| `W1` | differential-complex/coderivative | interpret the form carrier through the established skew Kähler–Dirac convention | (5) and (18) land on `mH+Hd-d^dag H`, consistent with the [May 17 Kähler–Dirac bridge](STAGGERED_DIRAC_SUBSTEP2_KAHLER_DIRAC_EQUIVALENCE_NARROW_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-05-17.md), hence on `+iM` in the Hermitian basis (`ATTEMPTED`, runner C; citation is non-load-bearing consistency only) |
| `W2` | fixed-stencil characteristic equation | identify the transfer pole and central Lorentz root as the same finite-spacing clock eigenvalue | the same `r` obeys `sinh E=r` and `sin omega=r`, different algebraic equations (`ATTEMPTED`, runner E/H) |
| `W2` | analytic-function identity | compare the two branches by series and at the exact point `r=1/2` | `asin r-asinh r=r^3/3+O(r^7)` and is nonzero at the exact point (`ATTEMPTED`, runner H) |
| `W2` | real-domain/branch structure | continue the central principal root through every transfer-admissible `r` | for `r>1`, `E` remains real while the principal `omega` is nonreal (`ATTEMPTED`, runner H) |
| `W2` | constant clock rescaling | posit `omega=cE` as a units convention | the linear term forces `c=1`, after which the cubic coefficients disagree (`ATTEMPTED`, runner H) |
| `W2` | determinant analytic continuation | use the exact substitution `s_t->i s_t` to identify the two time evolutions | (40)–(41) do match as polynomials, but the substitution supplies no equality of transfer eigenvalue and real-time update (`ATTEMPTED`, runner H) |

Changed-premise routes are not counted as defeated:

| live route | changed mechanism | disposition |
|---|---|---|
| `phi=-pi/2` | reverse time orientation | **ATTEMPTED — affirmative adjoint orientation** |
| transfer-derived Lorentz update | uses `E` as physical update energy | **UNTESTED — LIVE** |
| perfect/anisotropic action | changes temporal dispersion | **UNTESTED — LIVE** |
| controlled continuum reconstruction | removes finite-spacing mismatch | **UNTESTED — LIVE** |
| curved shifted-block construction | changes from flat fixed origin to overlapping geometry | **UNTESTED — LIVE highest gravity gate** |

### N2 — Wall-Independence Audit

| pair | W1 closes W2? | W2 closes W1? | independent? | reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `W1`,`W2` | no | no | yes | `W1` selects the Euclidean kinetic/mass phase; `W2` compares transfer and Lorentz time after the successful phase is already chosen |

The collapsed wall set is exactly `{W1,W2}`. The positive `Q_E` construction
closes `W1` by changing phase; it does not silently close `W2`.

### N3 — Hidden-Wall Scan

| phrase family | disposition |
|---|---|
| `assume`, `supplied` | the CAR/Grassmann branch, infinite vacuum time, and positive-time unbarred algebra are explicit source conditions |
| `by construction` | no load-bearing use; every phase and matrix equality is displayed and executed |
| `canonical` | means the declared time-first subset ordering, related to other orderings by an explicit constant relabeling |
| `background` | no dynamic background measure is imported; curved histories are open |
| `fine site`, `one mode` | exact direct-sum relabeling (6), not a physical taste-selection claim |
| `positive`, `OS` | flat free same-action positive-time unbarred theorem only |
| `Lorentz`, `Wick` | determinant-polynomial continuation only; exact finite-spacing reconstruction forbidden |
| `axiom`, `retained`, `TOE` | no edit, adoption, verdict, retirement, or score movement |

### N4 — Residual Matching

| source | exact source residual | current match | surviving residual |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Block 103 §9–10](ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_COCHAIN_HODGE_QUADRATIC_WARD_SHELL_LOCALITY_OS_REENTRY_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md) | supplied Gram was not identified with `M(H)` and fine-site placement was a candidate only | (3)–(38) give the exact flat same-action placement and Gram | curved shifted blocks and ADM transport remain |
| [July reflected-Gram theorem §1–4](FREE_STAGGERED_3PLUS1_REFLECTED_GRAM_CAR_FOCK_REPRESENTATION_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-07-12.md) | exact free staggered positive-time unbarred Gram on its supplied action | (27) maps that exact action to `Q_E`; (38) maps its reflection | source's barred/contact and interacting boundaries remain |

Both citations match the residual used. Neither contributes an imported audit
grade.

### N5 — Rhetoric And Granularity Audit

The strongest permitted sentence is: “The phase-selected flat free
Dirac–Kähler Euclidean kernel is exactly one-fine-mode-per-site equivalent to
the staggered action in `d=2,4` and inherits its source-bound positive-time
unbarred reflected Gram.” Forbidden upgrades include “Block 103's Hermitian
operator was already OS positive,” “curved gravity is reflection positive,”
“the full Lorentz theory is reconstructed,” “the zero mode is selected,” and
“the TOE gravity obligation is retired.”

```text
per_element: exact Clifford phases, Hodge Ward response, time-cell pole, reflected-Gram factors, and induced reflection are checked
per_site: one staggered Grassmann mode per fine site is exactly relabeled into 2^d exterior components on each even 2^d cell
per_mode: the reduced-BZ d=2 two-line Gram has rank two and the d=4 eight-spatial-line Gram has rank eight
per_block: the full flat free 2^4 carrier placement, same-action Euclidean kernel, and two-slice OS quotient are exact
lattice_wide: checked and not executed — curved histories, actual ADM cross-links, joint gravity, exact finite-spacing Lorentz reconstruction, zero-mode choice, energy, Records, selection, and retention remain open
```

### N6 — Partial-Closure Path Scan

| component | affirmative closure | remaining terminal |
|---|---|---|
| action phase | `phi=+/-pi/2` exhaustive inside the flat constant-phase family | physical orientation/adoption |
| Ward law | exact for `Q_E(H)` | gravity action selection and audit |
| site carrier | exact flat `2^d` fine-site distribution through `d=4` | shifted-block covariance for nonuniform H |
| matter positivity | flat free source-bound unbarred same-action Gram and induced reflection | curved histories and actual temporal link |
| massless sector | every nonzero spatial mode PSD | zero-mode prescription |
| Lorentz relation | exact polynomial continuation and continuum leading term | finite-spacing clock/update theorem |
| joint theory | exact next interface identified | gravity physical kernel, energy, Records, selection, retention |

The phase and site placement are model-law/convention bridges, not new
ontological premises. They must be tested and adopted before any amendment
question. This is substantial positive closure, but not obligation retirement.

### N7 — Steelman

**Hostile steelman against W1.** The flat failure of `mI+M0` does not threaten
Dirac–Kähler matter: `+iM` and `-iM` both have the exact isotropic singular
value required by the flat source covariance, and (5) proves they are the
familiar skew Kähler–Dirac action in a degree-phase
basis. A reviewer should reject every broad “Hodge fermions fail OS” headline.
The actionable terminal is only to choose the time orientation and carry the
successful `Q_E` into curved histories. This steelman defeats the broad no-go,
not the exact rank/singular-value boundary for `D_bad`.

**Hostile steelman against W2.** A transfer-first Lorentz theory can simply use
the reconstructed Hamiltonian energy `E`, and a perfect or anisotropic action
can be designed so its real-time update shares that dispersion. The original
central-time `asin` law is not mandatory physics. The actionable terminal is
to derive such an update from the Lattice/Record dynamics and prove its causal
and energy properties. This steelman defeats any broad Euclidean-to-Lorentz
no-go, not the exact finite-spacing inequality for the fixed central stencil.

Both broader negatives are therefore rejected; only `W1` and `W2` ship.

### N8 — Cross-Cycle Echo

The repository search found the following concrete echoes; these are
consistency/retirement precedents, not imported proof of the present algebra.

| earlier artifact and wall | later repair mechanism | discipline here |
|---|---|---|
| [May 17 Kähler–Dirac bridge](STAGGERED_DIRAC_SUBSTEP2_KAHLER_DIRAC_EQUIVALENCE_NARROW_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-05-17.md) distinguishes anti-Hermitian `d-delta` from Hermitian `iD` | a phase/convention change preserved the carrier while changing the physical operator reading | test `+/-iM` before universalizing failure of the real Hermitian sum |
| [April 30 physical-Hermitian bridge](PHYSICAL_HERMITIAN_HAMILTONIAN_AND_SME_BRIDGE_NOTE_2026-04-30.md) separated the hopping `D` from `H=iD` | the missing `i` was a downstream representation bridge, not a new ontology axiom | classify the present Wick phase as action law/convention unless later physics forces more |
| [July same-action reflected-Gram theorem](FREE_STAGGERED_3PLUS1_REFLECTED_GRAM_CAR_FOCK_REPRESENTATION_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-07-12.md) required the Gram to come from the actual staggered inverse | exact pole residue plus dense chain inversion removed a supplied-normalization wall | (30a)–(32) repeat that same-action check after the DK map |
| [August 10 compact-Regge rank block](ADMISSIBILITY_COMPACT_REGGE_HOMOGENEOUS_REACTION_RANK_KKT_BOUNDARY_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-10.md) separated earlier source/action “axiom” walls from downstream convention/import retirement | a selected action may be adopted without changing the four axioms | do not call phase or carrier placement an axiom necessity |
| [Block 103](ADMISSIBILITY_DIRAC_KAHLER_COCHAIN_HODGE_QUADRATIC_WARD_SHELL_LOCALITY_OS_REENTRY_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md) left its supplied Gram unmatched to `M(H)` | exact phase, fine-site, residue, and reflection maps now close only the flat residual | require curved same-action provenance before positivity credit moves farther |

**No-Go Discipline verdict:** **PASS** for the narrow flat-`D_bad` boundary
inside the declared constant-phase massive family and for the negative
statement that the fixed OS/central-time dispersions are unequal at generic
finite spacing. **FAIL** for Dirac–Kähler matter generally,
Euclidean positivity generally, transfer-derived Lorentz updates, continuum
reconstruction, curved gravity, axiom necessity, or TOE no-go.

## 12. Validation And Falsifiers

The runner has nine gates:

1. current authority, exact Block 103 parent, and exact reflected-Gram source;
2. Clifford algebra, scalar-covariance and antiunitary phase selectors,
   transfer recurrence, and the naive-kernel witness;
3. same-Hodge Ward identity and skew Kähler–Dirac degree phase;
4. exact `d=2,4` fine-site equivalence and carrier counting;
5. time-cell symbol, inside pole, and spatial-line multiplicities;
6. same-`D_lambda` pole residue/reordering, independent open-chain inverse,
   exact reflected-Gram factors/ranks, and massless/zero-mode controls;
7. induced Dirac–Kähler reflection and anti-linear placement phase;
8. polynomial Wick relation and finite-spacing Lorentz boundary; and
9. N1–N8, axiom, retention, and TOE firewall.

Hostile mutations are:

```text
stale_axiom_authority
stale_os_authority
use_naive_euclidean
drop_wick_phase
break_ward_response
drop_mass_hodge_response
forget_reduced_momentum
break_koszul_phase
co_located_overcount
wrong_time_cell_symbol
wrong_inside_pole
break_gram_factor
wrong_reflection_reorder
fake_taste_multiplicity
drop_induced_gamma_reflection
same_sign_temporal_placement
claim_exact_finite_lattice_lorentz
claim_odd_cell_embedding
claim_massless_zero_closed
weaken_no_go_packet
claim_axiom_update
claim_toe_progress
claim_obligation_retirement
```

Each must fail exactly one intended gate.

## 13. TOE Map And Portfolio Decision

The strict map remains unchanged:

| lane | exploratory | admissibility | retained | closure confidence |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| operational / Records | 95 | 92 | 50 | 99 |
| causal / time | 76 | 72 | 41 | 99 |
| inertia / matter | 95 | 96 | 75 | 99 |
| gravity / source / resources | 70 | 45 | 29 | 94 |
| Born / history | 84 | 63 | 34 | 99 |

There is zero obligation retirement. No TOE percentage moves. The
retained-positive end-to-end theory count remains zero.

Significant route progress is nevertheless real: the flat free full-4D
carrier placement and same-action reflected Gram are now explicit, and the
Euclidean phase is sharply selected inside its family. The priority stack is:

1. execute shifted-block covariance for nonuniform `H_site(e)` and the
   radius-two Hodge orbit under every fine translation;
2. derive the actual ADM/history transporter on that overlapping-cell carrier
   and test its common-link determinant Gram;
3. combine it with a positive physical gravity kernel or exact constraint
   reduction;
4. decide a transfer-derived Lorentz update or controlled continuum theorem,
   including the massless zero-mode prescription;
5. derive reciprocal recoil, constraint propagation, and total energy;
6. compile the joint state/action/cadence into Records; and
7. seek selection, adoption, independent retention, and only then change a
   TOE percentage.

No axiom amendment is presently indicated.
