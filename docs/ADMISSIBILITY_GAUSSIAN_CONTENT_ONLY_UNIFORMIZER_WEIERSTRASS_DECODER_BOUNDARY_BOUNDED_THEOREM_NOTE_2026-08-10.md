**Date:** 2026-08-10
**Type:** bounded theorem
**Construction:** positive common-uniformizer plus bounded fixed-decoder test

centers, the slice `C=tP_z`, one fixed half-projector effect, finite isotropic
extractor offset, and one fixed bounded content-readout kernel.
**Audit-status authority:** independent audit lane only. This note authors no
audit verdict and predicts none.

## Result Up Front

Block 4 constructed a Gaussian quantile compiler using
`Phi(Re Tr(A-C))`, explicitly conditional on a fixed center `C`. Block 5
accepted the steelman that a physical comparator could drive a CNOT control,
but left the comparator threshold, eigenbasis, program registration, and
occurrence open.

The Gaussian family contains a stronger positive object that removes one of
those inputs. Every center `C` is Hermitian, so `Im Tr C=0`. The two diagonal
imaginary noise coordinates have variance `1/2` each. Therefore

`S(A)=Im Tr A`

is standard normal for every center, and

`U(A)=Phi(Im Tr A)`

is a single content-only uniform variable shared by the whole Gaussian
family. Trace invariance makes it simultaneously unitary-conjugation
invariant. No center subtraction, neighbor lookup, or center-indexed
uniformizer is needed. On this displayed family the mathematical splitting
resource is closed across conditions.

That does not make one fixed Record decoder reproduce the varying extracted
effect grade. Let `r(A) in [0,1]` be any fixed bounded measurable readout
kernel for one label. Along `C=tP_z`, its Gaussian expectation `P_r(t)` extends
to an entire function of complex `t`. For the fixed effect
`E_0=(1/2)P_z`, every finite isotropic extractor member instead gives

`w_lambda(t)=(t^2+2+lambda)/(2(t^2+4+2lambda))`.

The denominator vanishes at `t^2=-(4+2lambda)`, while the numerator there is
`-(lambda+2)`, not zero. An entire function cannot equal this target on any
nonempty open real interval. This rules out not just threshold decoders but
every fixed deterministic or stochastic bounded content-only kernel on the
declared family.

The exact positive escape remains:

`d_(lambda,t)(A)=1{U(A)<=w_lambda(t)}`.

Because `U` is uniform, this condition-indexed threshold has exactly the
target weight. Randomness is no longer the missing interface. The remaining
interface is physical selection and storage of the condition/program index,
same-effect descent, and Record occurrence. A tagged or condition-indexed
decoder remains live. No global content-decoder or Record no-go is claimed,
and no canonical axiom is edited.

## Exact Target And Obligation Graph

**Exact target.** Strengthen the Gaussian comparator route as far as the
current content-only Record surface honestly permits. First seek a single
center-independent content uniformizer. Then decide whether one fixed bounded
readout of the locked matrix can reproduce the compiler's varying fixed-effect
weight without a preparation/program index.

| Obligation | Role | Disposition |
|---|---|---|
| one uniform scalar for all Hermitian centers | Gaussian splitting | closed by `Phi(Im Tr A)` |
| invariance under the displayed contact/covariance action | program neutrality | closed by trace invariance |
| realize one constant Bernoulli threshold at every center | fixed decoder | closed trivially |
| realize `w_lambda(t)` by one fixed bounded kernel on an open center interval | content-only Born decoder | impossible on the declared Gaussian family for every finite `lambda` |
| realize `w_lambda(t)` with a condition-indexed threshold | mathematical compiler | closed exactly |
| select `lambda`, `t`/preparation, effect, and threshold physically | selector/program tag | open |
| identify the same effect and preparation across programs | operational quotient | open |
| write the tag or label into Record content | Record compatibility | open |
| cause the program and Record, then extend to histories | occurrence/history | open |

The positive and negative parts are type-ordered. The common uniformizer is a
fixed function of the raw locked matrix. The successful threshold decoder is
then explicitly indexed by a condition-derived target value. The index is not
silently called record content.

## Gaussian Coordinates

Use the explicit family inherited from Blocks 3--5:

`d mu_C(A)=pi^(-4) exp(-||A-C||_HS^2)d^8A`,

where `C=C^dagger` is the Hermitian neighbor average. Write each complex entry
of `Z=A-C` in real and imaginary parts. All eight real coordinates are
independent with density `pi^(-1/2)exp(-x^2)`, mean zero, and variance `1/2`.

The diagonal entries of a Hermitian `C` are real. Hence

`Im Tr A=Im Z_00+Im Z_11`.

It is a sum of two independent `N(0,1/2)` variables and is therefore
`N(0,1)`. This fact holds for every Hermitian center, not only at one fixed
condition.

## Theorem 1 — One Common Content-Only Uniformizer

Let `Phi` be the standard-normal CDF and define

`U(A)=Phi(Im Tr A)`.

The probability-integral transform gives, for every Hermitian `C` and every
`u in [0,1]`,

`mu_C(U<=u)=u`.

The formula contains no `C`. It is a fixed Borel function of the local matrix
content alone. For every unitary `V`,

`Im Tr(V A V^dagger)=Im Tr A`,

so `U` is invariant under all simultaneous unitary conjugations, including the
finite contact conjugations used in Block 5. It is also insensitive to proper-
cubic rotation of the Hermitian center because trace is invariant under the
corresponding conjugation.

This strictly improves the earlier centered real-trace uniformizer. The latter
was content-only only after fixing `C`; this one is the same function across
the whole displayed Hermitian-center family. It closes neither the target
threshold nor the physical comparator.

## Theorem 2 — Every Fixed Bounded Readout Has An Entire Center Response

Fix the preparation slice

`C(t)=tP_z`, `t in R`.

Let `r:M_2(C)->[0,1]` be any fixed bounded Borel readout kernel. Indicators
cover deterministic label decoders; general `[0,1]` values cover stochastic
readout kernels. Define

`P_r(t)=integral r(A)dmu_(tP_z)(A)`.

Only the real coordinate `x=Re A_00` shifts with `t`. Integrating the other
seven coordinates first gives a Borel `g:R->[0,1]` such that

`P_r(t)=pi^(-1/2) integral_R g(x) exp(-(x-t)^2)dx`.

For complex `z`, define the same integral:

`P_r(z)=pi^(-1/2) integral_R g(x) exp(-(x-z)^2)dx`.

`P_r(z)` is entire. Indeed, on a compact set with
`|Re z|<=R`, `|Im z|<=S`,

`|exp(-(x-z)^2)|=exp(-(x-Re z)^2+(Im z)^2)`

is bounded by an integrable Gaussian independent of `z`; the same is true
after multiplying by every derivative polynomial in `(x-z)`. Dominated
differentiation gives holomorphy of all orders.

This result uses the full eight-dimensional decoder class. Integrating seven
coordinates into `g` is an identity, not a one-coordinate ansatz.

## Theorem 3 — The Extracted Effect Grade Is Not Such A Response

For the finite isotropic extractor family and `C=tP_z`,

`rho_lambda(t)=diag(t^2+2+lambda,2+lambda)/(t^2+4+2lambda)`.

Hold one exact effect fixed:

`E_0=(1/2)P_z`.

Its grade is

`w_lambda(t)=(t^2+2+lambda)/(2(t^2+4+2lambda))`.

Assume a fixed bounded `r` satisfies

`P_r(t)=w_lambda(t)`

on any nonempty open interval of real `t`, for one finite `lambda>=0`. Since
`P_r` is entire, the entire function

`F(z)=2(z^2+4+2lambda)P_r(z)-(z^2+2+lambda)`

vanishes on that interval and hence vanishes identically. Choose either
complex root with

`z^2=-(4+2lambda)`.

Then the first term in `F(z)` is zero, while

`-(z^2+2+lambda)=lambda+2>0`.

This contradiction proves:

> For every finite `lambda>=0`, no fixed bounded content-only readout kernel
> on the displayed Gaussian translation family reproduces the fixed
> half-projector grade on a nonempty open center interval.

For `lambda=0`, the target is especially transparent:

`w_0(t)=1/2-1/(t^2+4)`.

Its poles at `z=+/-2i` are nonremovable. The proof is not a threshold-only
argument and does not assume continuity of `r`.

## Theorem 4 — Condition-Indexed Thresholding Closes The Mathematics

The common `U` from Theorem 1 is uniform for every `t`. Therefore

`d_(lambda,t)(A)=1{U(A)<=w_lambda(t)}`

has

`mu_(tP_z)(d_(lambda,t)=1)=w_lambda(t)`.

The same condition-indexed threshold construction works for cumulative cuts
of every supplied finite ordered effect resolution. The random scalar itself
is fixed and content-only; only the cut is indexed.

For a fixed threshold `theta`, by contrast,

`mu_(tP_z)(U<=theta)=theta`

for every `t`. It cannot equal a nonconstant `w_lambda(t)`. The entire-function
theorem shows that replacing the threshold with an arbitrary fixed bounded
kernel does not evade the boundary.

The successful indexed decoder is not yet a physical Record law. One must
derive `lambda`, the preparation condition represented by `t`, the fixed
effect/program, the threshold, and the storage or registration of that index.

## Exact Axiom-Side Residual

The result removes a tempting but unnecessary axiom addition: this Gaussian
family needs no center-indexed randomizer and no external atom splitter. The
fixed matrix content already carries one common uniform scalar.

It also exposes three mutually exclusive ways to close the remaining mismatch:

1. **Tagged Record route.** The local law derives a covariant
   preparation/program tag, stores it in Record content, and applies one fixed
   readout to the enlarged stored content.
2. **Indexed-readout route.** Record explicitly licenses a physically
   registered decoder indexed by the local preparation/program condition,
   with an operational-effect quotient across program representations.
3. **Law-shape route.** Admissibility selects a different distribution family
   whose probability under one fixed content decoder already equals the
   desired condition-dependent grade.

A precise sufficient candidate, preserving content-only readout by storing the
tag, is:

> At a Record-forming site, the same fixed local rule derives a covariant
> preparation/program tag and stores it with the locked local possibility.
> The registered outcome decoder is one fixed measurable function of that
> stored content. For a fixed preparation class, decoder labels registered as
> the same operational effect have one pushforward probability across program
> representations. The local rule supplies any comparator/restriction used and
> causes the corresponding Record.

This is hypothetical wording only. The theorem does not prove that a tag is
minimal, that Record must be amended rather than Admissibility, or that any
axiom update is necessary. No canonical axiom is edited.

## Relation To Prior Results

The current
[`minimal axioms`](MINIMAL_AXIOMS_2026-06-29.md), lines 45--73 and 79--84,
supply a neighborhood-varying possibility measure and say that readout is
determined by Record content alone. They do not select a distribution form,
decoder, condition tag, or operational-effect quotient.

The
[`decoder-independence source`](ADMISSIBILITY_RECORD_CONTENT_DECODER_PUSHFORWARD_EFFECT_DESCENT_INDEPENDENCE_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-10.md),
lines 174--248 and 342--470, proves that content-only additivity does not select
one decoder and that decoder pushforward does not force effect descent. This
note asks a different question: whether one fixed decoder can at least realize
the already constructed varying Gaussian target.

The
[`Gaussian compiler source`](ADMISSIBILITY_GAUSSIAN_SECOND_MOMENT_QUANTILE_DECODER_EFFECT_QUOTIENT_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-10.md),
lines 193--215 and 302--332, constructs a fixed-condition centered-trace
uniformizer and explicitly leaves its physical encoding open. Theorem 1 here
removes the center parameter from the uniformizer itself.

The
[`CNOT contact/type-order source`](ADMISSIBILITY_CNOT_CONTACT_GAUSSIAN_EXTRACTOR_TYPE_ORDER_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-10.md),
lines 242--306 and 443--458, proves that a supplied control weight is carried
but not selected and accepts a direct comparator as the strongest live route.
Theorems 2--4 locate the comparator's exact remaining input.

## No-Go Discipline Gate

The negative claim is only about one fixed bounded content-only kernel on the
displayed Gaussian translation family, one fixed half-projector effect, and a
finite extractor offset. A tagged or condition-indexed decoder remains live.
No global content-decoder or Record no-go is claimed.

### N1 — materially distinct routes

| Route | Exact attack | Result | Marker |
|---|---|---|---|
| centered real-trace uniformizer | subtract `C` before applying `Phi` | succeeds at fixed `C`, but imports the center into the decoder | **ATTEMPTED** |
| imaginary-trace uniformizer | use `Phi(Im Tr A)` for all Hermitian centers | succeeds exactly and removes center-indexed randomness (Theorem 1) | **ATTEMPTED** |
| fixed threshold | cut the common uniformizer at one `theta` | gives the same probability at every center and cannot match varying `w_lambda` | **ATTEMPTED** |
| arbitrary deterministic decoder | replace the threshold by any Borel indicator of full matrix content | its Gaussian response is entire; pole contradiction applies (Theorems 2--3) | **ATTEMPTED** |
| arbitrary stochastic kernel | allow any fixed `r(A) in [0,1]` | the same entire-transform proof applies | **ATTEMPTED** |
| condition-indexed threshold | cut the common uniformizer at `w_lambda(t)` | succeeds exactly; physical index/tag registration remains open (Theorem 4) | **ATTEMPTED** |
| tagged Record content | store the derived condition/program tag with the locked possibility | viable constructive escape; no current write law or enlarged content type supplies it | **ATTEMPTED** |
| changed distribution law | encode the varying target mass into one fixed decoder event | viable outside the displayed Gaussian family; law selection remains open | **ATTEMPTED** |
| finite center set | interpolate only finitely many required probabilities | not excluded; the identity-theorem boundary needs an open interval | **ATTEMPTED** |
| record-derived process | reconstruct preparation/program fields from complete records | remains viable after a local process and occurrence law are derived | **ATTEMPTED** |

The positive routes materially shrink the negative scope. Only the fixed-kernel
Gaussian route reaches the analytic contradiction.

### N2 — wall independence and collapse

The common uniformizer closes splitting on the displayed Gaussian family, so
it is removed from this block's wall count. Three walls remain.

| Pair | First closes second? | Second closes first? | Disposition |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| target-weight/density-functional selection / condition-program tag and effect quotient | no: a number does not store its preparation/effect meaning | no: a tag does not choose `lambda` or the target functional | independent |
| target-weight/density-functional selection / occurrence-history law | no: a selected kernel does not cause a Record or trials | no: occurrence does not determine its probability target | independent |
| condition-program tag and effect quotient / occurrence-history law | no: a registered decoder need not occur | no: Records forming do not identify preparation or effect equivalence | independent |

For general current-compatible atomic laws, splitting remains a separate
global-law issue inherited from Block 4. It is closed only inside the displayed
Gaussian completion here.

### N3 — hidden-condition scan

| Item | Classification |
|---|---|
| full-support Gaussian form | constructed stacked completion; not selected by current axioms |
| Hermitian center | follows from the displayed neighbor-average construction |
| `C=tP_z` continuum | explicit preparation slice; realizable by equal Hermitian neighbor contents |
| standard-normal CDF | elementary analytic function; no observed distribution imported |
| bounded Borel kernel | covers every deterministic/stochastic probability readout for one label |
| fixed kernel across `t` | exact current content-only route under test; indexed escape stated separately |
| fixed half-projector effect | supplied mathematical probe; no physical effect registration inferred |
| finite `lambda` | declared extractor-family scope; infinite-offset constant boundary is not claimed |
| complex continuation | proof device derived from the Gaussian integral, not a physical complex center |
| preparation/program tag | absent and explicitly open |
| Record formation and history | absent and explicitly open |

No Born target, observed probability, preferred effect, program tag, outcome
frequency, IID ensemble, or occurrence rate is smuggled into the current axiom
surface.

### N4 — source residual matching

| Source location | Source residual used | Residual attacked here | Closure claimed here | Match |
|---|---|---|---|---:|
| [`MINIMAL_AXIOMS_2026-06-29.md`](MINIMAL_AXIOMS_2026-06-29.md), lines 45--73 and 79--84 | varying whole-domain measure plus content-only Record readout | ask what one fixed readout can realize across conditions | bounded Gaussian fixed-kernel result only | yes |
| [`decoder source`](ADMISSIBILITY_RECORD_CONTENT_DECODER_PUSHFORWARD_EFFECT_DESCENT_INDEPENDENCE_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-10.md), lines 174--248 and 342--470 | decoder selection and effect descent remain independent | hold the decoder fixed and test an already selected target | entire-response classification only | yes |
| [`compiler source`](ADMISSIBILITY_GAUSSIAN_SECOND_MOMENT_QUANTILE_DECODER_EFFECT_QUOTIENT_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-10.md), lines 193--215 and 302--332 | uniformizer works only after fixing `C`; physical encoding open | remove `C` from the uniformizer and isolate threshold indexing | common uniformizer plus indexed-threshold residual | yes |
| [`contact source`](ADMISSIBILITY_CNOT_CONTACT_GAUSSIAN_EXTRACTOR_TYPE_ORDER_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-10.md), lines 242--306 and 443--458 | CNOT carries supplied weight; direct comparator remains live | determine whether the comparator can be one fixed content readout | fixed-kernel rejected; indexed comparator succeeds | yes |

### N5 — resolution and rhetoric audit

| Statement | Per element | Per site | Per mode | Per block | Lattice-wide |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| common uniformizer | two diagonal imaginary coordinates | one `M_2(C)` content | every Hermitian center and unitary conjugation | displayed Gaussian family | analytic covariance only; no occurrence law |
| fixed-kernel response is entire | all eight content coordinates integrated | one site on `C=tP_z` | every bounded deterministic/stochastic kernel | one translation family | not claimed for changed laws or tagged content |
| target mismatch | exact numerator/denominator and both complex roots | same site/effect | every finite `lambda` and any open `t` interval | displayed extractor family | not claimed on finite center sets |
| indexed-threshold escape | every target cut of the common uniformizer | same site with supplied index | exact for every `t` and finite `lambda` | mathematical compiler | not executed; tag transport and Records absent |

The runner cache emits substantive `per_element`, `per_site`, `per_mode`,
`per_block`, and `lattice_wide` lines.

### N6 — live partial-closure and primitive paths

1. A contact law may compute `C`, `lambda`, and the effect tag, then store the
   threshold/program tag in local Record content.
2. A different Admissibility distribution may encode the varying target in
   one fixed decoder event, avoiding indexed readout.
3. A finite or discrete physical center spectrum may admit an exact fixed
   decoder even though no open-interval solution exists.
4. A nonunitary instrument or record-derived process may create the tagged
   outcome directly rather than read it from the raw Gaussian content.
5. An operational quotient may identify only a smaller preparation class on
   which the target becomes constant.
6. Owner-approved wording may explicitly register a condition-indexed decoder
   while preserving content-only readout by storing the index.

The primitive-registry scan used
`docs/audit/data/axiom_premise_nodes.json` and the three approved primitive
sources. The scale reference supplies units only, kinetic isotropy supplies a
kinetic-form ratio only, and the realized-state primitive supplies pointwise
evaluation only. None supplies a Gaussian law, decoder tag, effect quotient,
comparator, occurrence process, or distribution-shape selector.

### N7 — hostile steelman

> The theorem holds the readout fixed while varying a preparation parameter
> that the local neighborhood already determines. A real contact law can copy
> that neighborhood datum into the target Record or alter the distribution so
> the tag is implicit. Once the common imaginary-trace uniformizer is present,

> a physical limitation.

This steelman is accepted. The theorem's conclusion is exactly that the
untagged interface is too small on the displayed Gaussian family. It does not
reject a tag-writing contact, an indexed decoder, or a changed law. The next
terminal obligation is to derive that tag and its same-effect quotient from
the current local rule, or expose it as the narrow axiom-side addition.

### N8 — cross-cycle echo

| Earlier surface | Later movement | Echo here |
|---|---|---|
| Block 2 rejected raw singleton probability | Block 3 introduced decoder fibers | the whole content event, not a point mass, is still the correct object |
| Block 3 found content-decoder nonselection | Block 4 built an explicit indexed decoder | the present theorem asks whether the index can be removed and answers only for this Gaussian target |
| Block 4 needed center subtraction for its uniformizer | the imaginary-trace coordinate is center-free | one prior wall is genuinely retired on the displayed family |
| Block 5 found CNOT carries but does not select `q` | the common uniformizer supplies randomness | the missing `q` is now localized to a program tag rather than a stochastic resource |
| Cycle 189 reconstructed process fields from records | local implementation remained open | tag reconstruction remains viable after an occurrence/process law is derived |

**Gate disposition:** PASS for the common Gaussian content-only uniformizer,
the entire-response classification, the finite-`lambda` pole mismatch, and the
condition-indexed threshold escape. FAIL / DO NOT SHIP for a global decoder or
Record no-go, a discrete-center boundary, an axiom necessity claim, a physical
tag compiler, occurrence, or Born/history closure.

## Imports And Claim Boundary

| Item | Role | Status |
|---|---|---|
| current possibility measure and content-only Record clauses | semantic baseline | supplied; unchanged |
| displayed Gaussian family and Hermitian center | tested completion | inherited; not selected by current axioms |
| imaginary-trace normal law and CDF transform | common uniformizer | elementary calculation proved here |
| bounded Borel readout kernel | full fixed-decoder class | explicit theorem quantifier |
| complex entire continuation and identity theorem | analytic proof | elementary self-contained argument; no literature theorem imported |
| isotropic extractor and fixed `E_0` | target family/probe | inherited mathematical objects; not physical registrations |
| condition-indexed threshold | positive escape | exact mathematical construction; index not physically stored |
| canonical axiom edit | governance action | forbidden absent owner authority; not performed |

The finite set of centers remains live, as do tagged Records, indexed
decoders, altered distribution laws, nonunitary instruments, and derived
processes. The theorem does not move the fixed TOE percentages because no
current-axiom physical registration or autonomous occurrence obligation is
retired.

## Review Record

This source is stacked on PR #6071 because it consumes the explicit Gaussian
compiler, its conditioned-contact factorization, and the accepted comparator
steelman. All load-bearing mathematics is rederived in this source and runner.
The canonical axiom memo remains unchanged. Independent audit is required
before any effective status changes. No `review-loop` was invoked in producing
or directly self-reviewing this artifact.
