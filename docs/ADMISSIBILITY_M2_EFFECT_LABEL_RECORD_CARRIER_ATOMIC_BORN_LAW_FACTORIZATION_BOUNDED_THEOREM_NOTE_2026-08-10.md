## Result Up Front

The residual isolated in Block 6 does not require a larger one-site type. Let
`E` be a Hermitian qubit effect, let `ell` be a real outcome label, and define

`kappa(E,ell)=E+i ell I_2`.

This is one element of the already supplied possibility domain `M_2(C)`. The
two fixed content decoders

`Q(R)=(R+R^dagger)/2`,

`L(R)=(1/2) Im Tr R`

obey `Q(kappa(E,ell))=E` and `L(kappa(E,ell))=ell`. Consequently `kappa` is
injective on effect-label pairs. It is covariant under every simultaneous
unitary conjugation because the label occupies the central anti-Hermitian
direction. The existing eight-real-dimensional matrix type carries the four
real effect coordinates and one real label coordinate with three real
coordinates unused.

Now supply a finite effect resolution `(E_1,...,E_r)`, distinct labels
`(ell_1,...,ell_r)`, and a normalized positive functional `omega`. The atomic
measure

`nu=sum_j omega(E_j) delta_(kappa(E_j,ell_j))`

is a probability distribution on the existing one-site domain. The one fixed
decoder event for `kappa(E_j,ell_j)` has probability `omega(E_j)`. When
`omega_C(E)=Tr(rho_C E)` is the displayed Gaussian second-moment functional,
the common content uniformizer from Block 6 provides an exact deterministic
sampler of `nu`. At `C=P_z`, two rational ternary resolutions sharing
`E_0=(1/2)P_z` give the exact vectors

`(3/10,19/50,8/25)` and `(3/10,7/20,7/20)`.

The shared effect and label produce the same exact matrix codeword in both
programs with mass `3/10`. Along `C=tP_z`, that same codeword has mass

`(t^2+2)/(2(t^2+4))`,

so one fixed content-only decoder now has the required preparation-dependent
response. This does not contradict Block 6: the measure being decoded is the
condition-dependent atomic pushforward `nu`, not the untranslated raw
Gaussian measure `mu_C`.

This closes the `M_2(C)` storage/type question and the mathematical
content-decoder question for the displayed conditional construction. It does
not select the positive functional, derive the effect resolution from a
physical neighbor pattern, establish a preparation/program quotient, or turn
the sampler into an autonomous writer or history law. No canonical axiom is
edited, and the fixed TOE percentages do not move.

## Exact Target And Obligation Graph

**Exact target.** Decide whether the condition/program index required by the
Block 6 Gaussian comparator can be represented inside the current one-site
possibility domain, then separate representation from law selection.

| Obligation | Role | Disposition |
|---|---|---|
| store one qubit effect and one real label in one local possibility | Record-content type | closed by `kappa(E,ell)` |
| recover the effect and label by fixed content-only functions | decoder type | closed by `Q` and `L` |
| preserve simultaneous unitary/proper-cubic covariance | physical symmetry | closed for the carrier and co-transported program |
| extend the scalar label to finite additive Record readout | Record compatibility | closed algebraically |
| assign exact normalized effect masses | one-shot probability | closed conditional on supplied `omega` and effect resolution |
| reproduce the displayed Gaussian target by a deterministic sampler | factorization | closed conditional on `rho_C`, program, and common uniformizer |
| give one shared effect the same code and mass across supplied programs | fixed-preparation effect descent | closed in the displayed pair |
| derive `omega`, program, and preparation/effect equivalence from physical neighbors | local-law selection | open |
| cause the rule, formation site/rate, trials, and realized histories | autonomy/history | open |

The construction is deliberately type-ordered. `kappa`, `Q`, and `L` are
fixed matrix maps. The atomic distribution is a separate supplied law. A
formula that represents the desired law does not prove that the current four
axioms select it.

## Theorem 1 — An Exact M2 Effect-Label Carrier

Let

`Eff_2={E in M_2(C): E=E^dagger, 0<=E<=I_2}`.

For `(E,ell) in Eff_2 x R`, set

`kappa(E,ell)=E+i ell I_2`.

Define on all of `M_2(C)`

`Q(R)=(R+R^dagger)/2`,

`L(R)=(1/2) Im Tr R`.

Because `E` is Hermitian and has real trace,

`Q(kappa(E,ell))=E`,

`L(kappa(E,ell))=(1/2) Im(Tr E+2i ell)=ell`.

Thus `(Q,L)` is a left inverse of `kappa`; in particular, `kappa` is
injective. No effect-label collision is possible on the code surface.

The real dimension count is also explicit. `M_2(C)` has eight real
coordinates, its Hermitian subspace has four, and the central anti-Hermitian
label direction uses one more. Three real anti-Hermitian traceless coordinates
remain unused. This count is only a capacity statement, not a claim that every
program or preparation can be encoded canonically.

### Covariance

For every unitary `V`,

`kappa(VEV^dagger,ell)=V kappa(E,ell) V^dagger`,

`Q(VRV^dagger)=VQ(R)V^dagger`,

`L(VRV^dagger)=L(R)`.

The scalar label is not tied to a Bloch axis. Hence any supplied unitary
implementation of a proper-cubic rotation co-transports the effect while
leaving its label fixed. Applying the same formula at every translated site
introduces no privileged site.

## Theorem 2 — Fixed Content Readout And Finite Additivity

For a Record whose content is a codeword `R=kappa(E,ell)`, the pair-valued
readout `(Q(R),L(R))` is determined by content alone. For any finite collection
`F` of pairwise-disjoint Records define the scalar

`I_L(F)=sum_(R in F) L(content(R))`,

with `I_L(empty)=0`. If `F` and `G` are disjoint, then

`I_L(F union G)=I_L(F)+I_L(G)`.

This is exactly the algebraic finite-additivity shape named by Record. It does
not assert that `I_L` is the unique physical scalar readout, that the labels
have observed units, or that a Record forms with this content.

Distinct labels can be chosen globally for a finite program. If the same
effect is intended to have the same operational outcome in two programs, use
the same label. The resulting codeword is literally identical; no
context-dependent decoder is required after formation.

## Theorem 3 — Conditional Atomic Effect-Weight Law

Let `(E_1,...,E_r)` be a supplied finite effect resolution:

`E_j>=0`, `sum_j E_j=I_2`.

Let the real labels be distinct and let `omega` be a supplied normalized
positive linear functional on `M_2(C)`. Then

`p_j=omega(E_j)>=0`, `sum_j p_j=omega(I_2)=1`.

Therefore

`nu_(omega,M)=sum_j p_j delta_(kappa(E_j,ell_j))`

is a probability measure on `M_2(C)`. Its support contains only existing local
possibilities. The fixed decoder satisfies

`nu_(omega,M)({R:Q(R)=E_j and L(R)=ell_j})=omega(E_j)`.

If two supplied programs at the same preparation contain the same effect and
label, their corresponding decoded atom has the same mass because the mass is
a function of `omega` and `E`, not of the remaining menu entries.

This theorem is also a direct current-compatible Admissibility completion:
the local distribution can be `nu_(omega_eta,M_eta)` when the neighbor
condition `eta` supplies `omega_eta` and `M_eta`. The four axioms allow such a
law but do not select the map `eta -> (omega_eta,M_eta)`.

## Theorem 4 — Gaussian Uniformizer Factorization

Use the displayed Gaussian family

`d mu_C(A)=pi^(-4) exp(-||A-C||_HS^2)d^8A`

with Hermitian `C`, the common content uniformizer

`U(A)=Phi(Im Tr A)`,

and the second-moment functional

`omega_C(E)=Tr(rho_C E)`,

`rho_C=(C^2+2I_2)/(Tr(C^2)+4)`.

For a supplied ordered resolution write `p_j=omega_C(E_j)`, `c_0=0`, and
`c_j=sum_(k<=j)p_k`. Define the mathematical writer

`W_(C,M)(A)=kappa(E_j,ell_j)` when `c_(j-1)<=U(A)<c_j`,

with the measure-zero upper endpoint assigned to the final interval. Since
`U` is uniform under every `mu_C`,

`(W_(C,M))_* mu_C=nu_(omega_C,M)`.

The writer is deterministic after `A`, `C`, and the ordered program are
supplied. It is not a dynamics theorem. Equivalently, `nu` may be used
directly as the local Admissibility distribution without positing a temporal
Gaussian-to-Record conversion.

Under simultaneous transport

`C -> VCV^dagger`, `E_j -> VE_jV^dagger`,

the weights and quantile cuts are unchanged and every output codeword is
conjugated by `V`. The factorization is therefore covariant conditional on a
covariantly supplied program.

## Theorem 5 — Exact Shared-Effect Fixtures

At `C=P_z`,

`rho_C=diag(3/5,2/5)`.

Take the shared effect

`E_0=diag(1/2,0)`

and labels `(1,2,3)`. The following two rational ternary resolutions make the
carrier checks independent of irrational Bloch coordinates:

`M_A=(E_0, diag(1/2,1/5), diag(0,4/5))`,

`M_B=(E_0, [[1/4,1/4],[1/4,1/2]], [[1/4,-1/4],[-1/4,1/2]])`.

Every entry is positive semidefinite and each menu sums to `I_2`. Direct trace
evaluation gives

`p(M_A)=(3/10,19/50,8/25)`,

`p(M_B)=(3/10,7/20,7/20)`.

These are the same exact weight vectors as the scaled-projector fixtures in
Block 4, now on rational effect matrices chosen to expose the matrix carrier.
The menus share only `E_0`; with the shared label `1`, they share exactly the
codeword

`kappa(E_0,1)=diag(1/2+i,i)`.

Its mass is `3/10` in both programs. `Q` and `L` recover `E_0` and `1` without
knowing which program was used.

Along `C=tP_z`, the same second-moment functional gives

`omega_t(E_0)=(t^2+2)/(2(t^2+4))`.

It equals `1/4` at `t=0`, `3/10` at `t=1`, and `3/8` at `t=2`. Thus a single
fixed decoded codeword has a condition-dependent mass in the atomic law. The
analytic fixed-kernel boundary from Block 6 is evaded by changing the output
law through a supplied local factorization, not by finding a forbidden fixed
kernel on the raw Gaussian input.

## Exact Axiom-Side Residual

The carrier theorem removes one candidate amendment:

> No enlargement of the Qubit one-site possibility domain is needed merely to
> store one qubit effect and one real outcome label in Record content.

It also means the Record content-only clause need not be relaxed for this
route. Once a codeword is locked, `Q` and `L` are fixed content functions.

What remains is predominantly a law-selection obligation. One precise
sufficient candidate addition to Admissibility is:

> For each Record-forming site, the same fixed nearest-neighbor rule derives a
> normalized positive linear functional `omega_eta` and a finite registered
> operational-effect resolution `(E_(eta,j),ell_j)` with
> `sum_j E_(eta,j)=I_2`. It assigns the local possibility
> `E_(eta,j)+i ell_j I_2` probability `omega_eta(E_(eta,j))`. The assignment is
> translation- and proper-cubic-covariant. Neighbor conditions registered as
> the same preparation and outcomes registered as the same effect have the
> same functional value.

This wording would directly supply Born-form one-shot masses and a physical
preparation/effect quotient while retaining the existing `M_2(C)` content
type. It is hypothetical wording only. The theorem does not prove that this
addition is necessary, minimal, preferable to a downstream retained bridge,
or sufficient for histories. It is not adopted and the canonical axiom memo
is unchanged.

Separate obligations remain for:

- deriving rather than stipulating `eta -> omega_eta` and the effect program;
- identifying which physical neighbor patterns instantiate one preparation
  and one operational effect;
- selecting the raw second moment rather than another covariant positive
  functional;
- causing formation at particular sites and rates;
- defining trials, causal order, conditional independence or correlations,
  frequency typicality, and one realized history;
- coupling the probability/Record construction to the causal-time and
  gravity/source lanes.

## Relation To Prior Results

The current
[`minimal axioms`](MINIMAL_AXIOMS_2026-06-29.md), lines 31--73 and 79--84,
supply the `M_2(C)` possibility domain, a neighborhood-varying probability
distribution, and content-only additive Record readout. They do not specify a
density functional, effect program, atomic law, or operational quotient.

The
[`decoder-independence source`](ADMISSIBILITY_RECORD_CONTENT_DECODER_PUSHFORWARD_EFFECT_DESCENT_INDEPENDENCE_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-10.md),
lines 174--248 and 342--470, separates content decoder, pushforward, and
effect descent. The carrier here supplies an explicit code on which the fixed
decoders and same-effect atom coincide, conditional on the law.

The
[`Gaussian compiler source`](ADMISSIBILITY_GAUSSIAN_SECOND_MOMENT_QUANTILE_DECODER_EFFECT_QUOTIENT_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-10.md),
lines 119--215 and 302--340, supplies the second-moment functional and exact
quantile masses but leaves program storage open. The present code stores the
selected effect and label without enlarging the one-site type.

The
[`common-uniformizer boundary`](ADMISSIBILITY_GAUSSIAN_CONTENT_ONLY_UNIFORMIZER_WEIERSTRASS_DECODER_BOUNDARY_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-10.md),
lines 121--306 and 436--458, proves that raw Gaussian content cannot be read by
one fixed bounded kernel to obtain the varying target, while an indexed
threshold succeeds. The atomic writer is an explicit positive realization of
that indexed escape and makes clear where the index enters.

## No-Go Discipline Gate

The positive claim is the exact carrier and conditional atomic-law
factorization. The only negative conclusion is that this construction alone
does not select its physical law or produce histories. No global Born,
Admissibility, Record, contact, or axiom no-go is claimed.

### N1 — materially distinct routes

| Route | Exact attack | Result | Marker |
|---|---|---|---|
| enlarge the one-site content type | append an external effect/label register | unnecessary for one effect plus one real label because `kappa` is injective in `M_2(C)` | **ATTEMPTED** |
| relax content-only readout | let the decoder inspect the external program | unnecessary after the selected effect and label are written into the codeword | **ATTEMPTED** |
| raw Gaussian fixed decoder | decode the untranslated `mu_C` by one bounded kernel | excluded on the Block 6 open-center slice | **ATTEMPTED** |
| Gaussian indexed writer | use common `U` and condition-dependent cumulative cuts, then emit `kappa` | succeeds mathematically and yields the atomic law | **ATTEMPTED** |
| direct atomic Admissibility law | assign `nu_(omega_eta,M_eta)` without a temporal writer | succeeds as a compatible conditional completion | **ATTEMPTED** |
| changed continuous law | choose one fixed event whose mass is already `omega_eta(E)` | remains viable; not classified here | **ATTEMPTED** |
| contact-derived writer | derive the cut and codeword from an existing local process | remains viable; no such derivation is claimed here | **ATTEMPTED** |
| record-derived preparation/program fields | infer the quotient from a larger record process | remains viable after process and occurrence bridges | **ATTEMPTED** |
| finite-history construction | wire output atoms into trials and correlations | remains viable and is outside the one-site theorem | **ATTEMPTED** |

The direct-law route prevents the absence of a writer dynamics from being
misstated as an independent mathematical obstruction. The law-selection and
history questions remain physical obligations.

### N2 — wall independence and collapse

The one-site content capacity, fixed decoder, and atom-splitting resource are
closed inside the displayed construction. Three residuals remain.

| Pair | First closes second? | Second closes first? | Disposition |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| positive-functional/local-law selection / preparation-effect quotient | no: a functional formula does not identify physically equivalent conditions | no: an equivalence relation does not select probability values | independent |
| positive-functional/local-law selection / occurrence-history law | no: one-shot masses do not cause trials or order Records | no: an occurrence process need not carry Born-form masses | independent |
| preparation-effect quotient / occurrence-history law | no: operational identity does not form Records | no: Records forming do not identify equal preparations or effects | independent |

A separate dynamic writer wall collapses into local-law selection because the
direct atomic law is a live route. A writer is one possible implementation,
not a logically necessary extra stage.

### N3 — hidden-condition scan

| Item | Classification |
|---|---|
| `M_2(C)` as full one-site domain | supplied by Qubit |
| Hermitian qubit effects and real labels | supplied mathematical program objects; not selected physically |
| central anti-Hermitian label direction | derived from the existing algebra; no extra dimension imported |
| normalized positive functional `omega` | explicit conditional input |
| finite effect resolution | explicit conditional input |
| Gaussian family and second moment | inherited displayed completion; not selected by current axioms |
| common uniformizer | inherited exact theorem on that completion |
| atomic pushforward | derived measure; not asserted as a temporal process |
| equal effect/label across programs | explicit fixture and proposed operational registration |
| preparation/program quotient | absent and explicitly open |
| formation sites, rates, trials, history | absent and explicitly open |

No observed probability, preferred basis, apparatus, target frequency,
formation rate, IID ensemble, causal clock, or gravity source is imported.

### N4 — source residual matching

| Source location | Source residual used | Residual attacked here | Closure claimed here | Match |
|---|---|---|---|---:|
| [`MINIMAL_AXIOMS_2026-06-29.md`](MINIMAL_AXIOMS_2026-06-29.md), lines 31--73 and 79--84 | `M_2(C)` content, varying local distribution, content-only additive readout | test carrier capacity and compatible atomic law | exact one-site conditional construction only | yes |
| [`decoder source`](ADMISSIBILITY_RECORD_CONTENT_DECODER_PUSHFORWARD_EFFECT_DESCENT_INDEPENDENCE_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-10.md), lines 174--248 and 342--470 | decoder and effect descent are not selected | make both explicit on a coded atomic surface | fixed decoders and shared atom only | yes |
| [`compiler source`](ADMISSIBILITY_GAUSSIAN_SECOND_MOMENT_QUANTILE_DECODER_EFFECT_QUOTIENT_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-10.md), lines 119--215 and 302--340 | exact weights exist but physical program storage is open | encode selected effect and label in one matrix | carrier and mathematical writer only | yes |
| [`uniformizer source`](ADMISSIBILITY_GAUSSIAN_CONTENT_ONLY_UNIFORMIZER_WEIERSTRASS_DECODER_BOUNDARY_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-10.md), lines 121--306 and 436--458 | fixed raw decoder fails; indexed threshold succeeds | emit a fixed-decodable output after indexed selection | atomic pushforward escape only | yes |

### N5 — resolution and rhetoric audit

| Statement | Per element | Per site | Per mode | Per block | Lattice-wide |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| carrier inversion | every matrix entry of rational fixtures | one `M_2(C)` codeword | identity, Pauli-X, and phase conjugations | all supplied finite labels/effects | covariance only; no formation |
| atomic law | every menu effect and weight | one output site | two programs and several `t` conditions | displayed functional/program family | one fixed formula if neighbors supply the program |
| shared-effect descent | exact shared codeword | same output site | both rational ternary programs | fixed preparation `C=P_z` | no apparatus-equivalence derivation |
| Gaussian factorization | every quantile interval | one mathematical input/output pair | common uniformizer and atomic output | displayed Gaussian completion | no temporal dynamics or histories |

The runner cache emits substantive `per_element`, `per_site`, `per_mode`,
`per_block`, and `lattice_wide` lines.

### N6 — live partial-closure and primitive paths

1. A retained local contact may derive the positive functional, program, and
   effect-label code from neighbor Records.
2. Admissibility may directly select the atomic law, with no writer stage.
3. A changed continuous law may give the target mass to one fixed decoded
   event without atomic output.
4. A record-derived process may define preparation and program equivalence
   before applying the same carrier.
5. Owner-approved wording may explicitly supply the sufficient local-law
   clause stated above.
6. A separate causal-time construction may define trials and histories while
   reusing the one-site atomic law.

The primitive-registry scan used
`docs/audit/data/axiom_premise_nodes.json` and the approved primitive sources.
The scale reference supplies units only, kinetic isotropy supplies a
kinetic-form ratio only, and the realized-state primitive supplies pointwise
evaluation only. None selects a positive functional, effect program,
preparation quotient, atomic law, writer, formation site/rate, or history.

### N7 — hostile steelman

> Admissibility already grants one neighbor-dependent distribution over
> `M_2(C)`. The atomic measure displayed here is therefore a valid realization,
> and no axiom amendment or temporal writer is needed. Calling its selection a
> missing axiom may confuse an unspecified law with an inconsistent ontology.

This steelman is accepted. The construction proves compatibility and a
sufficient downstream bridge, not entailment. The missing item can be closed
by a retained derivation of the local law rather than an axiom amendment. The
hypothetical wording is recorded only because the campaign asks what an axiom
update would have to supply if no derivation is found.

### N8 — cross-cycle echo

| Earlier surface | Later movement | Echo here |
|---|---|---|
| Block 2 separated a whole-domain measure from singleton likelihood | Block 3 used decoder fibers | the atomic output makes the relevant decoded events literal atoms without confusing them with raw Gaussian points |
| Block 3 separated decoder choice from effect descent | Block 4 built a supplied compiler | identical effect-label codewords now realize descent after the law is supplied |
| Block 4 left program storage open | Block 6 found a program-independent random scalar | the carrier stores the selected effect and outcome label, while program selection remains upstream |
| Block 6 excluded one fixed raw Gaussian kernel | indexed thresholding remained live | the indexed writer followed by fixed output decoding is that live escape |
| prior record-process work reconstructed fields from Records | implementation and occurrence remained open | a later process can reuse `kappa` without changing its one-site type |

**Gate disposition:** PASS for the exact `M_2(C)` carrier, fixed decoders,
finite additive scalar, conditional atomic law, shared-effect fixture, and
Gaussian-uniformizer factorization. FAIL / DO NOT SHIP for current-axiom law
selection, a derived physical program/preparation quotient, autonomous writer
dynamics, formation site/rate, realized-history or frequency closure, axiom
necessity/minimality, or any TOE percentage increase.

## Imports And Claim Boundary

| Item | Role | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Qubit `M_2(C)` domain | carrier space | supplied; unchanged |
| Admissibility distribution and Record readout clauses | semantic baseline | supplied; unchanged |
| Hermitian effects, finite resolution, and labels | mathematical program | explicit conditional input |
| `kappa`, `Q`, and `L` | carrier and decoder | exact algebra proved here |
| normalized positive functional | target mass assignment | conditional input |
| Gaussian family, second moment, and common uniformizer | explicit factorization | inherited bounded completion |
| atomic output law | current-compatible constructed measure | derived conditional completion; not selected |
| preparation/effect quotient | physical identification | open |
| occurrence and histories | autonomous realization | open |
| canonical axiom edit | governance action | forbidden absent owner authority; not performed |

The theorem does not move the fixed TOE percentages because it retires no
current-axiom physical-selection or autonomous-history obligation. It does
narrow the prospective axiom change: enlarge neither Qubit nor Record content;
specify or derive the local positive functional, effect program, and physical
quotient on the Admissibility side, then solve occurrence/history separately.

## Review Record

This source is stacked on PR #6074 because it consumes the common Gaussian
uniformizer and the indexed-threshold escape. All load-bearing carrier,
decoder, covariance, exact-menu, and atomic-law arithmetic is rederived in
this source and runner. The canonical axiom memo remains unchanged.
Independent audit is required before any effective status changes. No
`review-loop` was invoked in producing or directly self-reviewing this
artifact.
