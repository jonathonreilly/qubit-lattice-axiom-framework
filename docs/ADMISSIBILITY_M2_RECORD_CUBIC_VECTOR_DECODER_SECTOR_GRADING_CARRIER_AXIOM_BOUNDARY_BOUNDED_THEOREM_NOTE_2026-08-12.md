claim_scope: "On the current Lattice/Qubit/Admissibility/Record axiom surface, two exact proper-cubic actions on the one-site M_2(C) possibility algebra remain compatible with the same explicit central binary nearest-neighbor probability rule: the trivial action and the Pauli-adjoint action. For the adjoint action, the linear proper-cubic-equivariance system from the traceless Hermitian Pauli coefficients to the physical cubic vector has rank 8 and nullity 1, so normalization fixes the Bloch-vector decoder. For the trivial action the same system has rank 9 and nullity 0, so no nonzero equivariant vector decoder exists. Thus the current text does not select the internal/external action or the vector decoder. Conditional on the adjoint action, four central role tags and six Pauli directions give an injective 24-symbol M_2(C) Record alphabet; four such Records reproduce every one of the 1,296 Cycle-876 incoming/matter/field/auxiliary balance configurations and the Block-55 96/768/432 rank census and 216/90 special counts exactly. This removes M_2(C) storage capacity as the obstruction, but does not physically select the action, decoder, role tags, sector compiler, grading, strict positivity, support-count maximization, generation-chirality carrier, gravity sign, or complete joint law.

# `M_2(C)` Record Vector Decoder And Sector-Grading Carrier Boundary

**Date:** 2026-08-12

**Type:** `bounded_theorem`

**Role:** test the first physical Root-B bridge after completion of the finite
projective grading algebra: whether the current one-site Record content and
lattice symmetry already provide the physical direction decoder and sector
carrier needed by that algebra.

**Audit-status authority:** independent audit lane only. This source authors
no audit verdict and predicts none.

**Premise sources:** the [current minimal axioms](MINIMAL_AXIOMS_2026-06-29.md),
the [incoming-pointer Record construction](ADMISSIBILITY_RECORD_WORLDLINE_CONSERVED_STRESS_TWO_TT_LORENTZIAN_CFL_LOCALITY_LSTAR_BOUNDARY_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-11.md),
the [Cycle-876 stipulated grading model](GRADING_AFFINE_CHART_ALGEBRA_CYCLE876_SUPPORT_NOTE_2026-08-09.md),
and the [complete projective classification](ADMISSIBILITY_SECTOR_GRADING_FULL_PROJECTIVE_STRATIFICATION_POSITIVE_SELECTOR_AXIOM_BOUNDARY_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-12.md).

**Primary runner:**
[admissibility_m2_record_cubic_vector_decoder_sector_grading_carrier_axiom_boundary_2026_08_12.py](../scripts/admissibility_m2_record_cubic_vector_decoder_sector_grading_carrier_axiom_boundary_2026_08_12.py)

## Result Up Front

The physical bridge fails at a more precise place than `M_2(C)` capacity.
The one-site algebra can encode the full stipulated sector ledger exactly.
What the current axioms do not choose is how a physical cubic rotation acts
on that algebra, which non-scalar Record decoder is readable, and which
encoded roles are the physical matter/field/auxiliary roles.

Write a Hermitian one-site possibility as

~~~text
A = tau I + v_1 sigma_1 + v_2 sigma_2 + v_3 sigma_3.       (1)
~~~

For the 24 proper cubic rotations `R`, the Pauli-adjoint action is

~~~text
alpha_R(A) = tau I + (R v).sigma.                           (2)
~~~

The runner constructs (2) as an exact algebra action and solves the complete
linear equivariance system

~~~text
T rho(R) = R T,       R in O,                               (3)
~~~

where `rho` is the action on the three traceless Hermitian coefficients and
`T` is a candidate direction decoder. For (2), (3) has rank eight on nine
unknowns and hence one-dimensional solution space. Fixing the normalization
`T=I` gives the usual Bloch-vector decoder

~~~text
v_i(A) = Tr(A sigma_i)/2.                                   (4)
~~~

This is a positive conditional carrier theorem, not yet a physical selection.
The trivial internal action

~~~text
beta_R(A) = A                                                (5)
~~~

is also an exact proper-cubic action by algebra automorphisms. Under (5), the
same system (3) has rank nine and nullity zero. No nonzero equivariant vector
decoder exists.

The two actions coexist with one identical current-axiom-compatible local
distribution. For an arbitrary `M_2(C)` neighbor content `A_j`, set
`b_j=1` exactly when `A_j=+I` and set `b_j=0` otherwise. On the central output
alphabet `{-I,+I}`, define

~~~text
P(+I | b_1,...,b_6) = (1 + sum_j b_j)/8,
P(-I | b_1,...,b_6) = 1 - P(+I | b_1,...,b_6).              (6)
~~~

Equation (6) is total on all six-neighbor `M_2(C)` conditions, strictly
positive, normalized, varies with the nearest-neighbor condition, depends only
on the proper-cubic-invariant neighbor count, and has central output support
fixed by both (2) and (5). It therefore supplies the same exact local
Admissibility rule and central Record-content surface under both internal
actions. Any shared formation schedule, realized draws, and additive
content-only scalar readout on that central surface can be held identical;
none is used by the distinction. No compatible infinite-volume joint law is
claimed or needed by this local-rule witness.

Consequently, the four current axioms do not entail (2) rather than (5), and
they do not entail (4). This is the decisive current-interface failure. It is
not a universal impossibility result: a downstream physical law can select
(2), or an axiom can state the action/decoder directly.

Conditional on (2), storage is easy. Choose four distinct central tags

~~~text
tau_in = -1, tau_m = 0, tau_f = 1, tau_a = 2                (7)
~~~

and the 24 Record contents

~~~text
A_(s,d) = tau_s I + D_d.sigma,
s in {incoming,matter,field,auxiliary},
D_d in {+/-e_1,+/-e_2,+/-e_3}.                              (8)
~~~

Trace recovers the role tag and (4) recovers the signed direction. The role
tag is invariant and the direction transforms by `R`, so every six-element
role orbit is proper-cubic covariant. Four contents of (8) reproduce the
Cycle-876 balance residual exactly:

~~~text
w_m (D_m-D_d) + w_f D_f + w_a D_a.                         (9)
~~~

The runner exhausts all `6*6^3=1,296` choices. It recovers the Block-55 rank
census `96/768/432`, unit count `90`, and the three unrestricted control
counts `216/216/216` without importing those tables into the computation.

Thus `M_2(C)` storage capacity is not the wall. The open physical content is:

1. select the adjoint internal/external cubic action rather than another
   current-compatible action;
2. make the normalized vector decoder readable or derive an equivalent
   relational decoder;
3. select a physical sector compiler and its role meanings rather than the
   illustrative tags (7);
4. select the projective grading and connect it to generation chirality and
   the gravity sign; and
5. bind all of this into the exact joint law already required by Root A.

This is an exact interface/axiom-choice result. It moves no TOE percentage.

## Exact Target And Obligation Graph

| obligation | exact evidence | disposition |
|---|---|---|
| fit four roles and six directions inside one-site `M_2(C)` | 24 distinct central-tagged Pauli contents (8) | closed conditionally |
| make the alphabet proper-cubic covariant | exact algebra action (2) on all 24 rotations | closed conditionally |
| derive a vector decoder after choosing (2) | equivariance rank 8, nullity 1; normalization gives (4) | closed conditionally |
| determine whether the axioms choose (2) | actions (2) and (5) share the exact rule (6) | not selected by current text |
| recover the complete stipulated grading balance | all 1,296 four-Record configurations reproduce (9) | closed conditionally |
| select the four physical roles/tags | tags (7) are illustrative supplied data | open |
| select the projective grading | Block 55 gives only a conditional positive selector | open |
| identify generation chirality and gravity sign | no map from the encoded ledger to either physical observable is supplied | open |
| bind the compiler to formation, clock, constraints, source, and history | requires the Root-A exact joint law | open |

The strongest next theorem is no longer a carrier-dimension question. It is:

> Derive from one exact physical joint law that proper cubic rotations act on
> readable Record content by (2), that the law's physical sector compiler is
> (8) or an equivalent quotient, and that its selected grading carries the
> generation-chirality and gravity-sign observable.

## 1. Exact Proper-Cubic And Pauli Algebra

The proper cubic group is reconstructed as all determinant-one signed
permutation matrices. There are exactly 24. The runner checks closure by all
`24^2` products and verifies that the orbit of one positive axis is exactly
the six signed directions.

Pauli-basis elements are represented over Gaussian integers. The exact
multiplication law is

~~~text
sigma_i sigma_j = delta_ij I + i epsilon_ijk sigma_k.       (10)
~~~

For every rotation and every pair among the four basis elements, the runner
checks

~~~text
alpha_R(XY) = alpha_R(X) alpha_R(Y).                        (11)
~~~

It also checks the representation law for every ordered pair of rotations.
The trivial action satisfies both identities immediately. These are two
genuine group actions on the same algebra, not two coordinate descriptions of
one already selected physical action.

## 2. Decoder Uniqueness Is Conditional On The Action

A linear decoder from the traceless Hermitian coefficients to the physical
cubic vector is a real `3 by 3` matrix `T`. Equation (3) for every group
element gives an exact integer linear system.

For the adjoint action `rho(R)=R`, the commutant of the cubic vector
representation is one-dimensional. The computed constraint rank is eight,
so `T=cI`. A nonzero normalization chooses (4). This is the exact finite-group
version of the familiar Pauli/Bloch identification.

For the trivial action `rho(R)=I`, equation (3) becomes `T=RT` for all `R`.
The cubic vector representation has no invariant vector, and the computed
constraint rank is nine. Therefore `T=0`.

Nothing about the abstract algebra `M_2(C)` alone chooses which external
lattice action is physical. The Qubit axiom says that possibilities are
distinguished by the supplied algebraic structure alone. Both actions preserve
that structure. The Lattice axiom supplies physical rotations, and
Admissibility requires covariance, but the axiom text does not specify the
homomorphism from those rotations into automorphisms of `M_2(C)`. Rule (6)
makes the resulting independence constructive rather than semantic.

## 3. Why Scalar Readout Does Not Repair The Fork

The Record axiom supplies a fixed scalar readout additive over disjoint
Records. It does not state the vector decoder (4).

Any proper-cubic-invariant scalar function is constant on the transitive
six-pointer orbit. Any invariant linear scalar on the traceless Pauli vector
vanishes: the exact invariant-covector constraint has rank three. In
particular, `Tr(D_d.sigma)/2=0` for all six directions. Therefore a covariant
scalar readout cannot recover a signed direction.

One can define a non-invariant scalar assigning six different numbers to the
six pointers, but then the external frame choice is new content. One can also
read several relational scalars and reconstruct a vector, but the relational
instrument and its comparison frame are likewise downstream law content. The
negative statement is only that the supplied scalar clause does not already
give (4), not that Record content can never expose direction.

## 4. The Exact `M_2(C)` Carrier

The central coefficient in (1) is rotation-invariant. Four distinct values
can therefore label four roles while the Pauli coefficient carries one of six
directions. Equation (8) is injective because trace gives `2 tau_s` and the
Pauli coefficients give `D_d`.

The particular numbers in (7) have no physical status. Any four distinct
central values work, and permuting their role meanings gives another
mathematical compiler. The result proves capacity and covariance, not role
selection. An exact joint law could instead encode roles relationally across
several Records; that route remains live.

For each support, decoding four Records gives `(d,m,f,a)` and the three-by-
three balance matrix

~~~text
M(d;m,f,a) = [D_m-D_d | D_f | D_a].                        (12)
~~~

The Record calculation and the vector calculation agree entry by entry.
Every Block-55 projective result therefore lifts to this conditional `M_2(C)`
carrier. None acquires physical authority merely by being encodable.

## 5. Exact Axiom-Choice Packet

There are two constitutionally different positive paths.

### Derivation Through The Joint Law

The preferred science target is an exact extensional Admissibility law or
record-faithful equivalence class that supplies:

1. the action `R -> alpha_R` on physical Record content;
2. the normalized readable vector decoder or relational equivalent;
3. the physical sector compiler and its object lineage;
4. the selected grading and sign meaning; and
5. the same formation, precedence, clock, constraint, source, and realized-
   history interfaces required by the Root-A five-control cut.

If one law does that, no separate Qubit or Record amendment is required.

### Direct Extensional Adoption

If the interface is adopted rather than derived, the smallest model-scoped
content exposed here is the conjunction:

> On the declared Pauli Record carrier, proper cubic rotation `R` acts by
> `alpha_R(tau I+v.sigma)=tau I+(Rv).sigma`, and the readable vector is the
> normalized coefficient `v`.

plus an exact sector compiler, and the Block-55 direct unit-grading datum

> The physical sector grading on that compiler is `[1:1:1]`.

The second sentence remains logically weaker than adding strict positivity
plus a universal lawful-support-maximization principle. The first sentence
does not select the illustrative tags (7); a complete adoption must name the
actual role semantics or an exact equivalent quotient.

Neither route is adopted here. The packet identifies exact missing content so
an axiom update cannot hide it behind the phrase “covariant law” or “Record
vector.”

## Promotion Value Gate

| gate | assessment |
|---|---|
| V1 -- high-fanout residual | directly attacks the Root-B physical `M_2(C)`-to-grading/chirality interface after projective algebra closed |
| V2 -- exact next decision | separates carrier capacity, internal action, decoder, sector compiler, and grading selector |
| V3 -- framework contact | uses the actual current axiom text and one explicit full local probability rule shared by both completions |
| V4 -- marginal content | adds the 24-symbol covariant Record embedding and the exact rank-8/rank-9 decoder fork, not another support-count grid |
| V5 -- reviewability | exact Gaussian-integer group/algebra checks, rational ranks, and exhaustive 1,296-support embedding |

The value gate passes because this is a decisive failure of the live
current-axiom bridge plus a positive capacity theorem and exact axiom-choice
packet. It does not pass the TOE-score gate. Accordingly, no TOE percentage
movement is claimed.

## No-Go Discipline Gate

The bounded negative is only:

> The current four-axiom text does not select the Pauli-adjoint
> internal/external cubic action or a nonzero equivariant vector decoder,
> because the displayed trivial and adjoint completions satisfy the same exact
> current-axiom local rule and disagree on decoder existence.

It is not claimed that a downstream joint law cannot derive the action,
decoder, compiler, or grading.

### N1 -- Alternative Route Enumeration

| normalized route | attack and outcome | marker |
|---|---|---|
| Pauli-adjoint action plus Bloch decoder | solve the complete equivariance system | `ATTEMPTED`; conditional positive, nullity one |
| trivial internal action | keep lattice action external while fixing all `M_2(C)` contents | `ATTEMPTED`; same central rule, decoder nullity zero |
| covariant scalar decoder | read signed direction through one scalar on the pointer orbit | `ATTEMPTED`; transitivity makes it constant, invariant linear form is zero |
| central role tags plus Pauli direction | fit the complete four-role/six-direction alphabet in one site | `ATTEMPTED`; exact conditional positive |
| relational multi-Record decoder | reconstruct direction from pair or neighborhood comparisons | live; requires a selected instrument and reference relation |
| lattice-placement compiler | encode sector roles or direction by geometric placement | live; requires a law selecting the placement grammar |
| downstream internal/external merger | derive the adjoint action from a physical spin/state law | live; must survive current dependency and physical-state boundaries |
| exact joint `L*` | bind action, decoder, roles, grading, source, clock, and history in one law | live preferred route |
| direct extensional axiom datum | adopt the action/decoder/compiler and unit grading explicitly | live governance route |

These routes differ by internal action, observable type, carrier arity,
spatial grammar, derivation source, and constitutional placement. A universal
carrier or chirality no-go is unavailable.

### N2 -- Wall-Independence Audit

After removing synonymous wording, five interfaces remain:

- `W_A`: physical action of proper cubic rotations on `M_2(C)` content;
- `W_D`: normalized readable direction decoder or relational equivalent;
- `W_C`: physical sector compiler and role/object lineage;
- `W_G`: grading domain and selector;
- `W_P`: identification with generation chirality and gravity sign inside the
  complete joint law.

Choosing `W_A` reduces a linear decoder to one scale but does not normalize it.
Choosing `W_D` does not name roles. Choosing roles does not select weights.
Choosing `[1:1:1]` does not prove physical chirality or gravity sign. A single
exact joint law may close several walls together, but none follows from
another on the present surface.

### N3 -- Hidden-Wall Scan

The Pauli basis, role tags, central binary support, neighbor-count rule,
four-Record block, and Cycle-876 balance grammar are explicit mathematical
choices. “Covariant” means equation (3), not verbal similarity. “Readable
vector” is additional to the current scalar-additivity clause. “Physical
sector” is not inferred from a central tag. The result neither assumes a
formation rate nor a realized history.

### N4 -- Residual Matching

| prior residual | present target | match? |
|---|---|---:|
| Cycle-876 supplied vector-readout ansatz | derive or price the direction decoder | yes |
| Block-52 conditional incoming-pointer code | test whether the current scalar readout selects that vector interpretation | yes |
| Block-55 physical carrier/selector gap | embed the complete algebra in actual `M_2(C)` contents and locate the first non-entailment | yes |
| Cycle-868/872 object lineage and sign carrier | connect the sector ledger to physical response/chirality | preserved open |
| Root-A joint-law cut | bind the compiler to formation, clock, constraints, source, and history | preserved open |

### N5 -- Rhetoric And Resolution Audit

The runner checks every Pauli basis product and special-point balance residual
(`per_element`), the complete one-site pointer orbit and all 64 neighbor
conditions (`per_site`), all 24 proper-cubic transformations and two internal
actions (`per_mode`), and all 1,296 four-Record support configurations
(`per_block`). It prints that no selected full-`Z^3` law, physical sector
compiler, chirality lineage, or gravity-sign theorem is executed
(`lattice_wide`). “Unique” is used only after the adjoint action and
normalization are supplied.

### N6 -- Partial-Closure And Primitive Scan

Partial closure is strong. The one-site algebra has enough exact capacity;
the adjoint completion gives a unique normalized decoder; and every projective
grading calculation embeds without loss. The current axioms and approved
primitives do not state the external-to-internal action or the physical sector
compiler. A downstream local law, relational Record instrument, physical
state-law theorem, or exact joint law can still supply them without changing
the four ontology sentences.

### N7 -- Steelman

The strongest objection is that “Admissibility is covariant” should be read as
already fixing the standard Pauli adjoint action. But covariance is meaningful
only after an action on possibilities is specified, and the text supplies no
such homomorphism. The central rule (6) is covariant under both the trivial and
adjoint choices, so the stronger reading adds precisely the missing content.
A future physical internal/external merger theorem may derive that content;
this block deliberately leaves that route live. The steelman succeeds in
preventing an axiom-necessity or universal-impossibility claim.

### N8 -- Cross-Cycle Echo

Earlier carrier work repeatedly found that an abstract Pauli/Clifford module
does not automatically choose its physical state transformation law, while
the Cycle-876 parent explicitly declared its vector readout supplied. This
block does not borrow stale retained labels from those rows. It rebuilds the
finite group/action fork on the current axiom text and converts the recurring
warning into one exact two-completion witness.

**N1--N8 status: `PASS` for the displayed current-axiom nonselection and
conditional carrier theorem.** A universal Root-B no-go fails N1, N6, and N7
and is not shipped.

TOTAL: PASS=8 FAIL=0
~~~

## Conclusion

The highest-value Root-B question was whether the physical bridge fails
because one-site Record content cannot carry the needed ledger. It can. A
simple exact covariant alphabet stores all four roles and six directions, and
the entire projective calculation lifts to it.

The decisive gap is selection: the four axioms admit an exact completion with
the Pauli-adjoint action and one with the trivial internal action, even while
the same local probability rule and Record behavior are held fixed. Only the
first has the required vector decoder. After that action is selected, the
remaining live work is the physical sector compiler, grading selector, and
generation-chirality/gravity-sign lineage inside one complete joint law.

That is where the next deep block must go. More carrier-dimension arguments,
projective counts, or bare gravity scans would not move the TOE.
