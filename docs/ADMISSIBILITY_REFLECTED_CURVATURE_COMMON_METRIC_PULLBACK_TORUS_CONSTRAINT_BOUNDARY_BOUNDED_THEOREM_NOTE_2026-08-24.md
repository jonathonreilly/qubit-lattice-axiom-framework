# Reflected-Curvature Common-Metric Pullback: Torus And Constraint Boundary

**Date:** 2026-08-24

**Campaign block:** 186

**Type:** `bounded_theorem`

**Status:** proposed bounded support only; no independent audit verdict.

TOE accounting: **zero obligation retirement, zero percentage movement, and

microscopic embedding identity. It does not supply a positively retained
end-to-end theory.

## 1. Result Up Front

Block 185 found that the raw edge covariance does not descend to common-metric
source classes, but it left a constructive escape: restrict the action to one
common metric before inversion. This block executes that escape at its honest
scope.

The regular-patch construction is exact and physically suggestive. The
twenty-two edge variables reduce to ten metric coordinates; four exact Ward
columns leave six off-shell metric classes. The same restriction pulls back
the edge source without ambiguity, and the resulting kernel approaches
linearized Einstein gravity with the expected quadratic lattice error. Both
spatial TT coordinates are positive on the complete declared odd-grid
interior atlas.

Three independent tests prevent promotion to a complete lattice gravity law:

1. two generic off-axis quotient poles visible to a conserved
   transverse-trace source occur while the metric map has full rank;
2. the symmetry-defined axial-even scalar block has the usual negative
   conformal direction unless a physical constraint/contour removes it; and
3. the supplied sinc line map is not a constant-rank function on the momentum
   torus: two labels for the same torus point have ranks eight and ten.

The first two failures share the unresolved scalar/constraint mechanism. The
torus-rank failure is independent. The exact bounded conclusion is therefore:

> The supplied continuum line-average map does not define a global periodic
> ten-component lattice carrier, and its Ward-only full metric inverse is not
> a positive covariance for all conserved metric sources. The hard pullback is
> a regular-chart microscopic embedding candidate, not a derived two-graviton
> law.

This is **not a gravity no-go**. Blocks 77 and 78 already exhibit a different,
periodic incidence carrier with exact linear constraints and a positive
depth-two TT cadence. Block 95 adds a first-order common scalar-matter action.
Those constructions are the strongest counterexample to any broad negative
reading of this block.

## 2. Authority, Target, And Non-Imports

The current axiom authority is
[`MINIMAL_AXIOMS_2026-06-29.md`](MINIMAL_AXIOMS_2026-06-29.md) at current
`origin/main` commit `c79384cb8ffa27fcb53cb89c53a84a708442eaad`, with
axiom blob `bc23300becfe4e4db57153c0e94cfcdf2338da71`. The axioms explicitly do
not choose a Hamiltonian, transfer operator, source/action identification,
time metric, or gravity law.

This block consumes, without promoting their audit status:

- the literal `mu=1/1024` reflected edge action, Ward map, and source boundary
  from [Block 185](ADMISSIBILITY_REFLECTED_CURVATURE_MOMENTUM_SOURCE_QUOTIENT_SIGN_BOUNDARY_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-24.md);
- the line-average metric and sectional-curvature maps from
  [Block 49](ADMISSIBILITY_REFLECTED_PLAQUETTE_CURVATURE_RECORD_RICCI_SOURCE_INTERTWINER_BOUNDARY_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-11.md);
- the conditional Einstein comparator and spatial TT coordinate convention
  used by [Block 76](ADMISSIBILITY_REFLECTED_CURVATURE_GRAVITY_PHYSICAL_RECONSTRUCTION_CUT_GATE_BOUNDARY_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md); and
- the periodic incidence comparison from
  [Block 77](ADMISSIBILITY_INCIDENCE_FIERZ_PAULI_SIGNED_RECORD_SOURCE_FULL_TENSOR_CADENCE_BOUNDARY_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md).

No Lorentzian contour, BRST quotient, lapse/shift constraint, positive-energy
state, quantum commutator, Record instrument, refinement map, nonlinear
background, path-integral measure, observed constant, selected action, audit
verdict, or axiom amendment is imported.

The exact target contract was:

| field | contract |
|---|---|
| target | derive a source-faithful common-metric reduction and test whether it is a global periodic, positive, two-polarization gravity carrier |
| allowed | supplied edge action, `M`, Ward map, curvature rows, and typed comparators |
| forbidden weakening | fitted hostile-eigenvector section, TT-only declaration before constraint derivation, half-open-chart concealment of Nyquist strata, or importing Einstein dynamics as an axiom |
| completion witness | periodic constant-rank local carrier, derived constraints, two physical tensor modes, positive physical source form, and compatible source/cadence map |
| not closure | an ordinary-point pullback identity, finite TT scan, infrared resemblance, or a source projection performed after inversion |

## 3. Exact Hard Pullback And Source Descent

For edge direction `n` of length `L_n`, the supplied line-average map is

\[
 M_{n,\mu\nu}(q)=
 {e^{i n\cdot q}-1\over i n\cdot q}
 { (2-\delta_{\mu\nu})n_\mu n_\nu\over2L_n}.       \tag{1}
\]

Let

\[
 \Gamma_{(\mu\nu),a}(q)=
 i(q_\mu\delta_{\nu a}+q_\nu\delta_{\mu a}).       \tag{2}
\]

Row-by-row cancellation of `n dot q` gives

\[
 M(q)\Gamma(q)=G(q).                                 \tag{3}
\]

With the Block-185 covariance-kernel convention `O_mu=-Q_mu`, the hard
restriction `e=Mh` gives

\[
 K_\mu(q)=M(q)^\dagger O_\mu(q)M(q),
 \qquad K_\mu\Gamma=0.                               \tag{4}
\]

The curvature intertwiner also retains an exact metric meaning:

\[
 D(q)M(q)=F(q)R(q),                                  \tag{5}
\]

where

\[
 (Rh)_i=q_i^2h_{tt}-2q_iq_t h_{it}+q_t^2h_{ii}.      \tag{6}
\]

At `q=(0.31,-0.47,0.23,0.19)`, the runner finds

| diagnostic | result |
|---|---:|
| `rank M`, `rank Gamma` | `10`, `4` |
| `norm(M Gamma-G)` | `3.36e-16` |
| `norm(O G)` | `2.61e-14` |
| `norm(K Gamma)` | `2.60e-14` |
| `norm(D M-F R)` | `6.09e-16` |

The source rule is not separately fitted. Restricting the same linear pairing
gives

\[
 j^\dagger e=j^\dagger Mh=\tau^\dagger h,
 \qquad \tau=M^\dagger j.                            \tag{7}
\]

Thus `j` and `j+d` with `d` in `ker M^dagger` are identical before inversion,
and edge conservation implies metric conservation:

\[
 G^\dagger j=0\quad\Longrightarrow\quad
 \Gamma^\dagger\tau=0.                              \tag{8}
\]

On a rank-ten patch every conserved metric source also has the minimum-norm
conserved edge representative

\[
 j_{\min}=M(M^\dagger M)^{-1}\tau.                   \tag{9}
\]

The runner's pullback, edge-Ward, and metric-Ward residuals for this
representative are all below `9e-16`.

## 4. Einstein Infrared Limit And Positive TT Control

For fixed generic direction `qhat`, the runner compares
`epsilon^-2 K(epsilon qhat)` with one half of the supplied Euclidean
linearized Einstein pairing. The relative errors are

| `epsilon` | relative error |
|---:|---:|
| `0.01` | `3.79244e-6` |
| `0.005` | `9.48032e-7` |
| `0.0025` | `2.37101e-7` |

Each halving reduces the error by approximately four. The curvature repair is
order `q^4`, so this result is compatible with, but does not select, the
Einstein infrared law.

The strongest positive finite-zone control uses the two analytic spatial TT
coordinates at each nonzero `L=7` spatial momentum. Across all
`342 x 7 = 2,394` spatial/temporal samples:

- the negative count is zero;
- the smallest eigenvalue is `0.0723661229`; and
- both coordinates are tested, not one chosen TT observable.

This positive atlas is deliberately retained in the result. The later
failures do not erase it; they show why TT positivity alone is insufficient.

## 5. Generic Off-Axis Full-Rank Transverse-Trace-Visible Poles

Use the unequal-component interior path

\[
 q(r)=(r,r-0.08,r-0.37,0.13).                        \tag{10}
\]

Let `Z` span `ker Gamma^dagger` and

\[
 H_\mu(r)=Z^\dagger K_\mu(q(r))Z.                    \tag{11}
\]

At `mu=1/1024`, its smallest eigenvalue has two simple zeros:

\[
 r_1=2.87885649110317,
 \qquad r_2=3.09811987863731.                         \tag{12}
\]

The minimum singular values of `M` are respectively `0.13672348` and
`0.05923562`; both fibers have rank ten. These are not rank-stratum artifacts.
The quotient inertia changes

\[
 (1-,5+)\ \longrightarrow\ (0-,6+)\ \longrightarrow\ (1-,5+). \tag{13}
\]

The source is analytic and symmetry-defined rather than fitted to a hostile
eigenvector. With

\[
 P_{\mu\nu}=\delta_{\mu\nu}-{q_\mu q_\nu\over q^2},
 \qquad
 \tau_{\mu\mu}=P_{\mu\mu},\quad
 \tau_{\mu\nu}=2P_{\mu\nu}\ (\mu<\nu),             \tag{14}
\]

one has `Gamma^dagger tau=0`. Across `r_1 +/- 1e-6`, its response changes from
`-1.83485e6` to `+1.83485e6`; across `r_2 +/- 1e-6`, it changes from
`+1.06426e5` to `-1.06406e5`.

The roots persist for `mu=0` and `mu=-1/1024`. Their largest shifts across
those two coefficient choices are respectively `3.1486e-4` and `1.4905e-4`.
At `mu=1/1024`, the crossing slopes are `+1.14612` and `-0.126175`, while
the next eigenvalues at the roots are `0.109684` and `0.0346626`; the two
zeros are therefore isolated and simple on this path.
More strongly, on a generic test fiber the curvature map has rank three on
the six Ward classes, and its three-dimensional kernel retains inertia
`(1-,2+)` independently of `mu`. Scalar tuning of the existing `D^dagger D`
coefficient therefore cannot make the Ward-only full metric form positive.
An independently derived scalar constraint or contour remains live.

## 6. Axial-Even Conformal Block

At static axial momentum `q=(k,0,0,0)`, take the symmetry-defined conserved
basis

\[
 s={h_{yy}+h_{zz}\over\sqrt2},\quad n=h_{tt},\quad
 c=h_{yz},\quad v={h_{yt}+h_{zt}\over\sqrt2}.         \tag{15}
\]

The infrared block is

\[
 {K_{\rm even}\over k^2}\longrightarrow
 \begin{pmatrix}
 -1/4&-1/(2\sqrt2)&0&0\\
 -1/(2\sqrt2)&0&0&0\\
 0&0&1/2&0\\
 0&0&0&1/2
 \end{pmatrix}.                                      \tag{16}
\]

Its scalar determinant is `-1/8`. At `k=2 pi/72`, the exact conserved
temporal source has positive response

\[
 C_{tt}=262.79712477,
 \qquad k^2C_{tt}=2.00131455,                         \tag{17}
\]

while the conserved transverse-trace source `diag(0,1,1,1)` gives

\[
 C_{\rm tr}=-788.36782795,
 \qquad k^2C_{\rm tr}=-6.00376434.                   \tag{18}
\]

This kills positive-GNS use of the **full Ward-only metric covariance**. It
does not prove a graviton ghost. In continuum gravity the conformal/lapse
sector is controlled by Lorentzian constraints, contour choice, or BRST
observables. The present edge action supplies none of those selections for
this hard pullback.

## 7. Brillouin-Torus Rank Boundary

The factor in (1) is not periodic:

\[
 {e^{i(x+2\pi m)}-1\over i(x+2\pi m)}
 \ne {e^{ix}-1\over ix}.                              \tag{19}
\]

Consider equivalent torus representatives

\[
 q_A=(\pi,\pi,\pi,0),\qquad
 q_B=(-\pi,\pi,\pi,0)=q_A-2\pi e_x.                 \tag{20}
\]

The edge action and Ward map agree to `3.2e-15` and `8.5e-16`, but

| quantity | `q_A` | `q_B` |
|---|---:|---:|
| `rank M` | `8` | `10` |
| `rank K` | `4` | `6` |
| Ward-quotient inertia | `(0-,4+,2 zero)` | `(1-,5+)` |

The image-projector gap is `2.47666`. An invertible fiber transition cannot
repair a rank change.

The exhaustive closed-cube corner census over `{-pi,0,pi}^4` gives 73
rank-ten, six rank-nine, and two rank-eight representatives. The six pair
aliases are common-sign spatial pairs with the remaining spatial coordinate
and time zero. The two rank-eight aliases are
`(+pi,+pi,+pi,0)` and `(-pi,-pi,-pi,0)`. At a pair alias, `h_xy` is in
`ker M`. At a triple alias, two independent spatial shear combinations are
lost.

At the static triple corner the two continuum spatial TT vectors are not zero
as metric vectors and have edge-carrier norm `0.36755`, but their images lie
in exact edge gauge. Both TT eigenvalues are below `7e-16`. Thus the positive
odd-grid TT atlas does not extend through the even-lattice Nyquist stratum.

Choosing a half-open momentum chart changes bookkeeping, not the fact that an
even periodic lattice contains the Nyquist point. A different periodic
carrier or transition system is required.

## 8. Physical And Axiom Disposition

The hard restriction has achieved four useful things:

1. one exact common metric embeds into the edge carrier on regular patches;
2. source equivalence is enforced before inversion rather than declared after;
3. the curvature term becomes the expected sectional-curvature quadratic; and
4. the infrared and interior TT behavior are quantitatively Einstein-like.

It has not achieved a selected physical reduction. Ward symmetry alone leaves
six metric classes, not two propagating gravitons. A complete construction
still needs a periodic local carrier, an independently derived constraint
matrix or BRST observable algebra, lapse/shift and zero-mode treatment, a
positive physical state, Record-source compilation, nonlinear closure,
refinement, and physical-law selection.

The minimal axioms never selected this action, line map, constraint surface,
or source cone. Failure of this candidate therefore exposes no axiom
inconsistency. No axiom amendment is justified. The existing periodic
incidence route is a physics-based escape and should be exhausted before any
owner-level axiom question is reopened.

Strict TOE map, unchanged:

| lane | exploratory | admissibility | retained | closure confidence |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| operational / Records | 95 | 92 | 50 | 99 |
| causal / time | 76 | 72 | 41 | 99 |
| inertia / matter | 95 | 96 | 75 | 99 |
| gravity / source / resources | 70 | 45 | 29 | 94 |
| Born / history | 84 | 63 | 34 | 99 |

There is **zero obligation retirement**. The retained-positive end-to-end
theory count remains zero.

## 9. No-Go Discipline Gate

The latest `origin/main` no-go discipline was used. The status below is only
for the narrow supplied-map claims, never for gravity.

### N1 — Alternative Route Enumeration

The routes are normalized by primary object, mechanism, and terminal proof
obligation.

| family | attack on the bounded conclusion | disposition |
|---|---|---|
| periodic local metric factorization | replace the sinc line average by a finite Laurent `M_per` satisfying `M_per Gamma_per=G`, then derive its pullback | **ATTEMPTED via prior positive carrier**: Block 77 constructs a periodic incidence Einstein carrier; it changes the supplied `M`, so it defeats a broad gravity no-go but not the narrow verdict |
| ADM/BRST constraint reduction | derive scalar/vector constraints and test only their two-dimensional physical kernel | **ATTEMPTED at comparator scope**: Blocks 77/78 close the linear constraint cadence on a different carrier; no intertwiner to this hard pullback is supplied |
| torus transition atlas | glue the two boundary representatives by an invertible fiber transition | **ATTEMPTED**: ranks eight and ten at the same torus point forbid an invertible transition for the supplied ten-coordinate map |
| coefficient repair | tune the existing `mu D^dagger D` term to remove the scalar directions | **ATTEMPTED**: both poles persist at three signs and the curvature-null quotient retains inertia `(1-,2+)` independently of `mu` |
| TT/source-cone restriction | license only the two TT observables or a smaller compiled Record-source cone | **ATTEMPTED as a positive control**: the 2,394-mode interior TT atlas passes, but no physical law selects that cone and the Nyquist TT images alias into gauge |
| hard restriction versus Schur elimination | integrate out nonmetric edge modes instead of imposing `e=Mh` | **RULED OUT BY PRIOR only for the two Block-76/181 stationary charts**: those are different reductions with their own poles; no general elimination no-go is imported |
| Lorentzian contour or changed action | change the conformal contour, Palatini/connection variables, or microscopic action | **UNTESTED — LIVE**: this is the strongest reason the result is not a gravity no-go |

At least five genuinely different families were tested or matched to prior
executed constructions. Live families force the narrow classification.

### N2 — Wall-Independence Audit

The raw list collapsed to two load-bearing conditions:

- `W_T`: a global periodic constant-rank metric carrier;
- `W_C`: a derived physical constraint/observable reduction with a positive
  licensed source form.

Source-cone selection and the scalar/conformal sign are downstream parts of
`W_C`, not independent walls.

| pair | closing first closes second? | closing second closes first? | independent? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `W_T`, `W_C` | no: a periodic carrier need not supply constraints | no: a chart-local constraint can leave torus rank mismatch | yes |

The note uses this collapsed two-condition set.

### N3 — Hidden-Wall Scan

The phrases `canonical`, `physical`, `background`, `registered`, and
`by construction` were inspected. `Canonical` appears only in names or as a
target not supplied. `Physical` is always qualified by the missing reduction.
`Background` names nonlinear work not executed. `Registered` concerns audit
or premise status and is non-load-bearing. `By construction` is avoided as a
proof substitute. The line map, hard constraint, source cone, inner product,
measure/Jacobian, contour, zero-mode treatment, Record compilation, and law
selection are all explicit conditions; none is hidden as framework content.

### N4 — Residual Matching

| cited witness | witness residual | residual used here | match? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ADMISSIBILITY_REFLECTED_CURVATURE_MOMENTUM_SOURCE_QUOTIENT_SIGN_BOUNDARY_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-24.md:172-201` | raw covariance does not descend; metric-first reduction remains open | execute the hard pullback before inversion | yes, exact parent target |
| `ADMISSIBILITY_REFLECTED_CURVATURE_GRAVITY_PHYSICAL_RECONSTRUCTION_CUT_GATE_BOUNDARY_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md:81-101` | supplied reductions lack the Hamiltonian constraint / positive completion | classify the six-class hard pullback and its scalar sector | yes for constraint target; that note's Schur chart is not reused as this result |
| `ADMISSIBILITY_INCIDENCE_FIERZ_PAULI_SIGNED_RECORD_SOURCE_FULL_TENSOR_CADENCE_BOUNDARY_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md:142-190` | periodic incidence operator has exact Ward/Bianchi and lapse/shift constraints | positive counterexample to broad carrier/gravity failure | yes as an escape, not a negative witness |
| [Block 78](ADMISSIBILITY_INCIDENCE_ADM_DEPTH_TWO_SOURCED_CONSTRAINT_RECORD_CADENCE_BOUNDARY_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md), lines 22-31 | all four linear sourced constraints propagate under the depth-two cadence | surviving path for `W_C` on another carrier | yes as a live construction |
| [Block 95](ADMISSIBILITY_INCIDENCE_SCALAR_GRAPH_MATTER_FIRST_ORDER_TOTAL_WARD_CADENCE_BOUNDARY_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md), lines 42-57 | first-order common source/recoil Ward closes; nonlinear order remains | portfolio redirect beyond prescribed sources | related downstream route, not evidence for the present negative |

The last row is not counted as support for either bounded-infeasible verdict.

### N5 — Rhetoric Audit

The runner's cached stdout contains substantive `per_element:`, `per_site:`,
`per_mode:`, `per_block:`, and `lattice_wide:` lines. The exact resolution is:

| resolution | executed conclusion |
|---|---|
| per element | all 22 edge, 10 metric, and four Ward coordinates plus explicit sources are checked |
| per site | no finite-range site stencil is supplied by the sinc line map; a site-local no-go is not claimed |
| per mode | two off-axis roots, 2,394 TT samples, 81 closed-cube corners, and equivalent torus representatives are checked |
| per block | only the literal Block-185 action/line-map/source interface is bounded |
| lattice wide | nonlinear geometry, general Records, refinement, and a selected gravity law are not executed |

Forbidden broader phrases are `no local metric carrier exists`, `gravity is
not positive`, `gravity cannot work`, and `the axioms exclude gravity`.

### N6 — Partial-Closure Path Scan

No statement equivalent to “no retained primitive supplies this” is made, and
no new axiom is requested. The strongest partial closures are scientific:

| path | status | closes |
|---|---|---|
| Block 77 periodic incidence carrier | proposed/unaudited positive construction | periodic linear Einstein operator, four constraint types, two TT modes |
| [Block 78](ADMISSIBILITY_INCIDENCE_ADM_DEPTH_TWO_SOURCED_CONSTRAINT_RECORD_CADENCE_BOUNDARY_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md) sourced depth-two ADM cadence | proposed/unaudited positive construction | exact linear constraint propagation and front-loaded source schedule |
| [Block 95](ADMISSIBILITY_INCIDENCE_SCALAR_GRAPH_MATTER_FIRST_ORDER_TOTAL_WARD_CADENCE_BOUNDARY_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-14.md) common scalar action | proposed/unaudited positive construction | first-order source/recoil mixed-Hessian and Ward interface |

These are candidate import-retirement paths, not premises and not reasons to
amend the axioms.

### N7 — Steelman

> A hostile reviewer should reject any broad negative conclusion immediately:
> the calculation has tested the wrong global carrier. The sinc map is the
> Fourier transform of a continuum line average, not a periodic finite-Laurent
> site field. Block 77 already shows that staggered placement phases and
> `2 sin(q/2)` differences produce a local periodic Einstein carrier with the
> correct constraints, and Block 78 supplies its source cadence. The actionable
> route is to construct a periodic edge-to-incidence intertwiner, prove
> constrained equivalence only on the licensed two-TT/source complex, and let
> the scalar sector be removed by the derived ADM/BRST law. Until that
> commutative diagram is tested, this block says nothing negative about gravity.

This steelman is convincing, so the result is deliberately a bounded
supplied-map boundary rather than a no-go.

### N8 — Cross-Cycle Echo

Block 76 previously found that two supplied line-metric canonical charts did
not reproduce a positive complete two-TT reconstruction. Block 185 then showed
that raw source projection fails but a hard metric-first restriction remained
live. This block executes that restriction and localizes two independent
conditions.

More importantly, prior scalar-matter walls were retired by changing the
primary carrier: Block 95 escaped the continuous-pullback obstruction with a
native lattice scalar, and the Dirac--Kahler/Hodge chain escaped later
rank-one scalar Ward boundaries with a degree-closed carrier. The same
mechanism can apply here. Therefore changed periodic carrier, constraint, and
action routes remain explicit and the broad no-go is rejected.

**N1--N8 status: PASS for the narrow supplied-map claims. FAIL for any broad
gravity, local-carrier, axiom, or TOE no-go; none is submitted.**

## 10. Portfolio Decision And Next Exact Experiment

The reflected edge action should no longer receive unconstrained covariance or
more scalar-`mu` tuning work. Its remaining high-value role is microscopic:
test whether local Record-edge sources can embed into the already stronger
periodic incidence/Dirac--Kahler gravity complex.

The decisive next diagram is

\[
 M_{\rm per}\Gamma_{77}=G_{\rm edge},\qquad
 M_{\rm per}^\dagger O_{\rm edge}M_{\rm per}
 \sim K_{77}\ \hbox{on the derived constraint quotient},              \tag{21}
\]

with

\[
 M_{\rm per}^\dagger j_{\rm Record}=T_{77}.            \tag{22}
\]

The earliest kill is algebraic: if no bounded-support periodic
`M_per` can satisfy the Ward/source diagram on one generic momentum and the
Nyquist strata without inverse powers of lattice momenta, stop trying to use
this edge action as the incidence carrier's microscopic completion. If it
passes, test the Block-78 constraint cadence and only then OS positivity,
nonlinear recoil, Records, and refinement.

This is the highest-value new edge/gravity experiment exposed by the block.
The independent portfolio panel may still rank a later Dirac--Kahler/Record
root above it; in that case this diagram becomes a bounded fallback rather
than the next campaign.
