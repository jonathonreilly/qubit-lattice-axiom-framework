# Autonomous Intermittent Record Instrument: Classification And Calibration Nonselection

**Date:** 2026-07-11

**Type:** bounded theorem

**Status authority:** independent audit only. This source changes no axiom,
approved primitive, framework rule, or audit verdict.

**Primary runner:**

## Question

The previous finite-carrier results leave an apparent conflict. Raw exhaustive-menu
repeat certainty gives `E_i=P_i`, but an intermittent normalized instrument
with a no-record outcome has formation effects `(1-q)P_i` and empty effect
`qI`. The correct full-instrument question is therefore:

```text
what does cross-label exclusion select conditional on a formation event,
when the mathematical no-record outcome occurs on an attempt?
```

This note gives the exact finite answer and then tests whether autonomous reuse
and absorbing auxiliary locked-register sectors derive the needed calibration.

## Existing-science reading gate

The actual instrument stack was read and its runners replayed before this
attack:

- the approved
  [`minimal axioms`](MINIMAL_AXIOMS_2026-06-29.md) supply Lattice, Qubit,
  Admissibility, generic Record occurrence, permanence, readability, and finite
  scalar readout additivity, but no formation rule, instrument, probability,
  update, context, time, or rate;

- finite normalized isometry implies Kraus completeness, a CPTP unconditional
  map, and positive normalized selective branches; the relevant rows are still
  in independent-audit processing;
- the reconciled finite-dimensional
  [`Kraus--Choi authority`](KRAUS_CHOI_REPRESENTATION_NORMALIZATION_RECONCILED_NARROW_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-06-05.md)
  supplies existence of a Kraus representation for a named CP map with the
  normalization convention kept explicit; current-main validation records the
  row as `audited_clean` / effective `retained`, with status remaining
  pipeline-derived;
- any named normalized Kraus family gives an explicit block-column Stinespring
  isometry (`29/0`), but the physical family is not selected;
- the controlled-copy/fresh-fragment model gives projective `K_i=P_i`,
  dephasing, and repeat-stable one-hot labels (`75/0`) inside its named pointer,
  Darwinism, fresh-fragment, time, and calibration conditions;
- the kernel (`48/0`), pre-record (`38/0`), and selective-atom (`33/0`)
  interfaces correctly keep possible-outcome weights, realized atoms, and
  post-record histories as different object types;
- the composition-semigroup runner still passes `28/0`, but its cache wrapper
  carries an older runner hash and the theorem concerns classical weight
  convolution, not overlapping CP instruments;
- the live narrow no-go grants generic occurrence from Record but leaves the
  formation process, site, state, weight, and rate open (`6/0`).

The rank-one locked-output input used here is
[`RECORD_OBSERVABLE_QUOTIENT_AND_RANK_ONE_FORMATION_OUTCOME_OPERATION_NORMAL_FORM_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-07-11.md`](RECORD_OBSERVABLE_QUOTIENT_AND_RANK_ONE_FORMATION_OUTCOME_OPERATION_NORMAL_FORM_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-07-11.md):

```text
J_i(rho)=Tr(E_i rho) P_i,       E_i>=0.                    (1)
```

Apart from the named finite Kraus-representation authority, all algebra below
is proved directly. Earlier intermittent and raw-menu campaign blocks are
comparators, not additional proof authority.

## 1. Full intermittent effect classification

Let `H=C^d`, and fix a complete rank-one menu
`P_i=|i><i|`, `sum_i P_i=I`. Consider a finite CP instrument with outcomes
`{empty,1,...,d}`. Let the nonempty branches have the locked-output form (1),
and let

```text
F := J_empty^*(I) >= 0                                      (2)
```

be the no-record effect. Full normalization is

```text
F + sum_i E_i = I.                                          (3)
```

Impose **conditional repeat/exclusivity** only:

```text
Tr(P_j E_i)=0        for i!=j.                              (4)
```

Equation (4) says that if the input already occupies locked possibility `j`,
a nonempty outcome cannot produce a cross-label outcome `i`. It does not demand
that a nonempty event occur on every attempt.

### Theorem

Equations (1)--(4) imply, for unique `0<=e_i<=1`,

```text
E_i = e_i P_i,
F   = sum_i (1-e_i)P_i.                                    (5)
```

**Proof.** For fixed `i`, equation (4) makes every diagonal entry of positive
`E_i` vanish except possibly the `i`th. For a positive semidefinite matrix,

```text
|(E_i)_(jk)|^2 <= (E_i)_(jj)(E_i)_(kk),                    (6)
```

so each zero diagonal kills its full row and column. Hence `E_i=e_iP_i` with
`e_i>=0`. Equation (3) gives the second formula in (5), and `F>=0` gives
`e_i<=1`. QED.

For input `P_j`, the no-record probability is `q_j=1-e_j`; conditional on a
nonempty outcome, the label is exactly `j` whenever `e_j>0`. Thus conditional
cross-label exclusion fixes the direction of each formation effect but not its
event efficiency.

If the no-record event is permutation-neutral on the fixed menu,

```text
q_i=q  for every i,                                         (7)
```

then

```text
E_i=(1-q)P_i,       F=qI.                                  (8)
```

For an arbitrary input density operator,

```text
p(empty)=q,
p(i)=(1-q)Tr(P_i rho),
p(i | nonempty)=Tr(P_i rho).                               (9)
```

The last equality is Born-form conditional weighting under the named CP/trace
and probability interpretation. This note does not derive probability
semantics from the four axioms.

Without (7), conditional selection is detection-biased:

```text
p(i | nonempty)
  = e_i Tr(P_i rho) / sum_j e_j Tr(P_j rho).                (10)
```

Permutation-neutral event gating, not normalization alone, removes that bias.

## 2. Complete CP-instrument normal form; channel selection remains free

Conversely, choose any numbers `0<=e_i<=1` and any CP map `J_empty`
whose effect is `F=sum_i(1-e_i)P_i`. Together with

```text
J_i(rho)=e_i Tr(P_i rho)P_i,                                (11)
```

these maps form a normalized instrument by equation (3). Thus equations
(5) and (11), plus the explicitly arbitrary CP map with complementary effect
`F`, are the complete abstract finite-cell normal form within the named
rank-one locked-output/conditional-repeat class. This parameterizes every
member; it does not select a unique instrument.

Let `{L_alpha}` be Kraus operators for `J_empty`. Equation (8) fixes only

```text
sum_alpha L_alpha^dag L_alpha = qI.                         (12)
```

For `q>0`, `J_empty/q` is an arbitrary CPTP channel. If the no-record
operation has one Kraus operator, polar decomposition gives

```text
L=sqrt(q)U,       U unitary.                                (13)
```

Thus the earlier one-Kraus unitary freedom is the rank-one special case of the
full classification. A unitary channel and a dephasing channel can have the
same effect `qI` while acting differently on coherence.

An explicit Stinespring isometry for the classified instrument is

```text
V|psi>
  = sum_alpha |empty,alpha> tensor L_alpha|psi>
    + sum_i |i> tensor sqrt(e_i)P_i|psi>,                   (14)
```

because `V^dag V=F+sum_iE_i=I`. The labels in (14) are mathematical outcome
registers. This note does not identify the external labels as framework
Records.

## 3. Autonomous auxiliary-register countermodel

The remaining auxiliary question is whether absorption plus reuse of one
CPTP channel on a supplied finite system/register decomposition forces (4). It
does not.

Let the register have basis `{|empty>,|1>,...,|d>}`. For `0<=a<=1` define

```text
w_(ij) = a delta_(ij) + (1-a)/d.                            (15)
```

Fix `0<=q<1`. On the blank register use the Kraus operators

```text
N       = sqrt(q) I tensor |empty><empty|,
B_(ij)  = sqrt((1-q)w_(ij)) |i><j| tensor |i><empty|.       (16)
```

On every already locked register sector use

```text
R_(ij) = |i><j| tensor |i><i|.                              (17)
```

The complete family `{N,B_(ij),R_(ij)}` obeys

```text
sum K^dag K
 = I tensor |empty><empty|
   + sum_i I tensor |i><i|
 = I.                                                       (18)
```

It is therefore one autonomous CPTP channel on the full blank-plus-locked
carrier. Its blank-sector formation effects are

```text
E_i=(1-q)[aP_i+(1-a)I/d],       F=qI.                       (19)
```

For every locked label `i`, equation (17) resets the system to `P_i`, keeps
the auxiliary register in `|i>`, and is idempotent under reuse. These are
absorbing register-label/system-reset statements; no physical readout map or
framework-Record realization has been constructed. Yet for `a<1`, a blank
input `P_j` has nonzero cross-label formation weight for `i!=j`.

The construction is equivariant as a supplied-menu family. If `C_P` denotes
the channel built from menu `{P_i}` and `W_U=U tensor I_register`, then direct
conjugation of every system matrix unit in (16)--(17) gives

```text
C_(UPU^dag)[ W_U X W_U^dag ]
  = W_U C_P[X] W_U^dag.                                   (20)
```

This is equivariance of a menu-parameterized family, not invariance of one
menu-independent framework law. The construction is finite on one supplied
system/register carrier, normalized, and stable under sequential reuse. It is
not yet framework-local on `Z^3`.

Therefore:

```text
absorbing locked-register sectors + same-map reuse + menu-family equivariance
  do not imply blank-sector cross-label exclusion.          (21)
```

The exact missing cross-sector condition is that blank-sector formation be
calibrated to locked-register stabilization. Calling that stabilization a
physical readout or Record permanence requires a separate framework
realization; the auxiliary construction supplies neither.

This is a narrow auxiliary-register countermodel, not a no-go against deriving
calibration from a stronger process theorem. A coupling law tying blank-sector
formation to locked-sector stabilization, overlapping-cell consistency, or a physical
coarse-graining theorem remains a live route.

## 4. Physical residuals

The theorem gives the complete effect surface and CP-instrument normal form on
one abstract finite cell, with the no-record CP operation left as an explicit
parameter. It is not a `Z^3` locality or overlapping-cell classification. The
following remain separate:

1. selecting the physical rank-one readout context;
2. realizing the mathematical locked register and a readout map as a framework Record on `Z^3`;
3. deriving conditional repeat/exclusivity across blank and locked sectors;
4. deriving permutation-neutral event gating rather than unequal `e_i`;
5. selecting `q`, the conditional no-record CPTP channel, and a stopping rule;
6. composing overlapping local instruments into one simultaneous lattice law;
7. selecting event order, physical time, and rate.

The last two items are the next campaign seams. Disjoint tensor composition is
exact, but overlapping instruments need not commute and are not classified by
the classical record-composition semigroup lane.

## 5. Boundaries

- The approved `minimal_axioms` dependency chain-satisfies. Finite
  CP-instrument interpretation, the supplied rank-one menu, system/register
  decomposition, label/menu association, probability semantics, physical
  readout, conditional repeat/exclusivity, event neutrality, and
  framework-Record realization remain conditional/open interfaces and acquire
  no chain-satisfying premise authority here.
- The autonomous countermodel is a finite mathematical register construction;
  it does not identify the external labels as framework Records.
- The theorem does not derive probability semantics, outcome realization, or
  a Born rule from empirical counts.
- It does not derive a pointer, Darwinism bridge, controlled-copy Hamiltonian,
  fresh-fragment supply, or register calibration from Record.
- It does not select event order, rate, or the no-record channel.
- It does not construct a translation-covariant overlapping-edge instrument,
  simultaneous cubic QCA, continuum limit, Standard Model, or GR sector.
- It does not establish that the axioms require amendment. The exact hostile
  channel leaves stronger process/composition derivations open.
