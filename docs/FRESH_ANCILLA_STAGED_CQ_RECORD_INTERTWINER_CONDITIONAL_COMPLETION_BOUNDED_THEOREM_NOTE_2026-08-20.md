claim_scope: "For the exact supplied delayed A/B qubit instruments, the common binary {K0,B} front and both residual binary instruments admit normalized finite Stinespring isometries. Coupling each orthogonal pointer label to a supplied fresh blank fragment by controlled label copy gives, after the pointer ancilla is forgotten, the exact label-retaining cq channel. The two-stage append-only path channel is intertwined exactly with each flat ternary instrument for every Hermitian input, without a scalar probability table as input. An explicit append-aware writer uses three memory qubits plus the live system; a faithful terminal cq-algebra representation needs only three qubit sites including the system. At rho*=diag(3/5,2/5), a fixed ensemble-level calibration reproduces every Block-6 typed Record history and its central-sector masses. Four spanning density preparations with retained label-times-Pauli observables force every A/B branch effect and reject a positive normalized affine CP measure-prepare wrong-effect law that agrees with the full front cq state at rho*, while a supplied tag-forgetting channel proves algebraic preparation affinity. The full binary cq algebra M2 direct-sum M2 has complex dimension eight and the ternary algebra has dimension twelve, so neither can be faithfully represented inside one M2 site by a complex-linear/*-algebraic encoding. An explicit injective real-affine code for normalized binary cq states shows that arbitrary one-site codes are not excluded. This is a conditional positive completion of the cq writer/intertwiner and an exact narrow one-site capacity boundary. It is not an actual-member theorem and does not derive the physical identification of the channel's central restriction with the Admissibility distribution, Record typing/formation, apparatus/program selection, fresh-fragment genesis, overlap scheduling, a formation schedule, or physical time. No axiom amendment, audit verdict, obligation retirement, or TOE percentage movement is claimed."

## 1. Result Up Front

The two Block-7 routes selected by the Block-6 five-physicist panel can be
made to inhabit one exact fixture at the **ensemble/channel level**.

For each delayed context \(c=A,B\), let the exact ternary instrument be

\[
 \mathcal K_c=(K_0,K_{c1},K_{c2}),\qquad
 \sum_{j=0}^2 K_{cj}^\dagger K_{cj}=I.                 \tag{1}
\]

It has the common exact binary factorization

\[
 K_0,\quad B=\sqrt{I-K_0^\dagger K_0},\qquad
 J_{cr}=K_{cr}B^{-1},\quad
 \sum_{r=1}^2J_{cr}^\dagger J_{cr}=I.                 \tag{2}
\]

The fresh-fragment writer first records the orthogonal label `0` or `B` and,
only after `B`, appends residual label `1` or `2`. Its three path operators
are exactly

\[
 K_0,\qquad J_{c1}B=K_{c1},\qquad J_{c2}B=K_{c2}.       \tag{3}
\]

Consequently the probability-independent path channel

\[
\begin{aligned}
 W_c(\rho)={}&
 |000\rangle\!\langle000|\otimes K_0\rho K_0^\dagger\\
 &+|110\rangle\!\langle110|\otimes K_{c1}\rho K_{c1}^\dagger\\
 &+|111\rangle\!\langle111|\otimes K_{c2}\rho K_{c2}^\dagger ,
\end{aligned}                                                   \tag{4}
\]
is carried by the path decoder to the flat label-retaining cq channel

\[
 \Gamma_c(\rho)=\bigoplus_{j=0}^2K_{cj}\rho K_{cj}^\dagger              \tag{5}
\]
for every input. Equation (5) is a channel identity: the writer takes the
operators and \(\rho\), not a scalar branch-weight table.

At the exact Block-6 preparation
\(\rho_*=\operatorname{diag}(3/5,2/5)\), fixed calibration of each path label
and branch operator produces precisely

```text
A: (C0), (CB,CA1), (CB,CA2)
B: (C0), (CB,CB1), (CB,CB2).
```

The center of (5) has exact masses

```text
A: (3/10, 19/50, 8/25)
B: (3/10,  7/20, 7/20).
```

Thus Block 6's previously supplied cq/Record ensemble identity now has an
explicit fresh-ancilla channel realization and exact decoder on the same
fixture. This is significant positive connector progress.

The result is nevertheless a **conditional positive completion**. Current
axioms do not say that the probability state selected by Admissibility is the
central restriction of this quantum channel, nor do they type the coherent or
pointer-forgotten fragment as a formed Record. The channel output is not one
actual path merely because it is block diagonal.

## 2. Authority And Supplied Inputs

The load-bearing inputs are explicit:

1. the exact two effect menus and post-contact Lüders Kraus programs;
2. ordinary finite-dimensional density-operator, Kraus, partial-trace, and
   direct-sum cq semantics;
3. one fresh blank binary label fragment at each copied-pointer stage, plus
   one separately supplied fresh residual-occupancy flag for the explicit
   append-aware writer;
4. one supplied blank Stinespring-pointer ancilla at each binary stage,
   controlled orthogonal label copy, an explicit pointer-forgetting/export
   channel and sink, and a supplied discrete ordering of the front and
   residual interactions;
5. the Block-6 typed-code calibration at the single fixed preparation;
6. four separately supplied tomographic preparations and the formal
   label-system observables used as algebraic separating functionals;
7. a supplied physical tag state and tag-forgetting/screening channel; and
8. the preloaded Block-6 apparatus and delayed context placement.

The [current axioms](MINIMAL_AXIOMS_2026-06-29.md#the-four-framework-axioms)
supply a local probability distribution and fixed Records but explicitly
withhold the distribution's extensional form and values, formation site/rate,
record-production dynamics, and time. The
[realized-state primitive](REALIZED_STATE_PRIMITIVE_NOTE_2026-06-11.md#the-primitive)
supplies a pointwise actual-state reference and no selection rule. Neither is
silently enlarged here.

The historical
[persistent-instrument construction](PERSISTENT_RECORD_INSTRUMENT_CONSTRUCTION_NARROW_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-05-22.md)
and [controlled-copy theorem](RECORD_FORMATION_CONTROLLED_COPY_WRITE_ISOMETRY_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-06-18.md)
are prior finite-model algebra, not current retained physical-selection
authority. Their needed block-isometry and copy identities are recomputed on
the exact A/B fixture.

## 3. Exact Programs And Repeated Interaction

In the post-contact representation the two exact menus are rank-one scaled
projectors (E_{cj}=a_{cj}P_{cj}), so

\[
 K_{cj}=\sqrt{a_{cj}}P_{cj}=E_{cj}/\sqrt{\operatorname{Tr}E_{cj}}.       \tag{6}
\]

Both menus sum to \(I\). Their shared first effect is

\[
 E_0=\begin{pmatrix}1/2&0\\0&0\end{pmatrix},\qquad
 K_0=\begin{pmatrix}1/\sqrt2&0\\0&0\end{pmatrix},\qquad
 B=\begin{pmatrix}1/\sqrt2&0\\0&1\end{pmatrix}.        \tag{7}
\]

Since \(B\) is invertible, (2) is literal. The primary and independent
executables prove exact residual completeness and \(J_{cr}B=K_{cr}\) for both
contexts. Applied to \(\rho_*\), the six positive branch operators are exactly
the `Sigma0`, `SigmaB`, `SigmaA1`, `SigmaA2`, `SigmaB1`, and `SigmaB2` matrices
used by Block 6; no tolerance-level state substitution is made.

For either binary stage, stack the two operators as an isometry

\[
 V|\psi\rangle=|0\rangle K_0|\psi\rangle
                  +|1\rangle K_1|\psi\rangle.           \tag{8}
\]

Attach a fresh blank memory label and apply controlled modular addition from
the pointer to that label. In the runner's \(P\otimes M\otimes S\) ordering,
define

\[
 \widetilde V=(C_{P\to M}\otimes I_S)
 (I_P\otimes |0\rangle_M\otimes I_S)V .
\]

Tracing only the now-redundant pointer gives

\[
 \operatorname{Tr}_{P}[\widetilde V\rho\widetilde V^\dagger]
   =\bigoplus_jK_j\rho K_j^\dagger.                     \tag{9}
\]

The runner constructs the finite matrices in (9) and verifies it on a
tomographically spanning family at the front and both residual stages. The
composition of these cq maps retains the earlier label during the residual
write, so every continuation path retains the prefix `B`; the `0` path
terminates without a second residual label.

The runner also constructs one coherent append-aware Stinespring
implementation

\[
 S_c:\mathcal H_{M_1}\otimes\mathcal H_S
 \longrightarrow
 \mathcal H_{M_1}\otimes\mathcal H_F\otimes
 \mathcal H_{M_2}\otimes\mathcal H_S ,
\]

with

\[
\begin{aligned}
 S_c(|0\rangle\otimes|\psi\rangle)&=|000\rangle\otimes|\psi\rangle,\\
 S_c(|1\rangle\otimes|\phi\rangle)&=
 |110\rangle\otimes J_{c1}|\phi\rangle+
 |111\rangle\otimes J_{c2}|\phi\rangle .
\end{aligned}
\]

Here \(F\) is an explicit residual-occupancy flag. Composing \(S_c\) with
the front isometry gives exactly the three blocks in (4), and
\(S_c^\dagger S_c=I\). This implementation uses three memory qubits plus the
live system—four qubit factors total. It is an explicit append-aware
implementation, not a claim that the extra flag is algebraically minimal.
After the first write and attachment of fresh blank \(F,M_2\), the pending
prefix is \(100\); the residual isometry maps it to \(110\) or \(111\).
The flag certifies residual execution inside this supplied finite circuit,
not framework Record formation, stability, or permanence.

This is a fresh-ancilla repeated-interaction writer for the cq path object. It
does not claim that tracing a pointer is physical collapse or that the fresh
fragment has already become a framework Record.

## 4. Exact Channel Intertwiner And Typed Calibration

Let the path decoder on the fixed basis of (4) be

\[
 d_c(000)=0,\qquad d_c(110)=1,\qquad d_c(111)=2.         \tag{10}
\]

Equations (2)-(3) prove

\[
 (d_c)_*W_c(\rho)=\Gamma_c(\rho)                        \tag{11}
\]

as a symbolic identity for every Hermitian (2\times2) input. This is the
probability-independent readout/intertwiner requested by the terminal
Block-6 panel.

At \(\rho_*\), apply the already-declared typed calibration

\[
 \kappa(\sigma,j)=\sigma+ijI.                            \tag{12}
\]

The first `B` block becomes `CB=kappa(SigmaB,1)` and the residual blocks become
the context-specific terminal codes. This \(\kappa(\sigma_j,j)\) use is a
fixed ensemble-level lookup on the subnormalized blocks at \(\rho_*\); it is
not a branch-local CPTP calibration acting on a normalized postbranch state.
The original Block-6 Record prefix is therefore preserved literally.
Equation (11) supplies the cq ensemble object whose equality was previously a
separate premise, **inside this finite instrument/fresh-fragment model**.

The calibration is not promoted to a universal quantum channel. For a rich
unknown preparation family, writing a classical code that injectively
contains both the label and the full retained conditional qubit state would
attempt to compress the full cq algebra into one site.

## 5. Narrow One-Site Capacity Boundary And Counterroutes

The binary state-retaining cq algebra is

\[
 M_2(\mathbb C)\oplus M_2(\mathbb C),                   \tag{13}
\]

of complex vector-space dimension \(8\), while one site has algebra
\(M_2(\mathbb C)\) of dimension \(4\). The terminal ternary algebra has
dimension \(12\). Therefore no injective complex-linear representation, and
hence no faithful \(*\)-algebraic representation, of either full cq algebra
inside one \(M_2\) site exists. This is the exact narrow negative theorem in
this block.

The linear/\(*\)-algebraic scope is load bearing. A normalized binary cq
state \(A\oplus B\), written

\[
A=\begin{pmatrix}a&x+iy\\x-iy&b\end{pmatrix},\qquad
B=\begin{pmatrix}c&u+iv\\u-iv&1-a-b-c\end{pmatrix},
\]

has the explicit injective real-affine one-site code

\[
\Phi(A\oplus B)=
\begin{pmatrix}a+ib&x+iy\\u+iv&c\end{pmatrix}.
\]

The seven input coordinates are recovered entry by entry. But \(\Phi\)
preserves neither products, \(*\), positivity/order, nor the cq observable
algebra. It is a raw identifier rather than a faithful physical
representation. The normalized ternary affine hull has real dimension
\(11>8\), so no real-affine injection of that entire hull into a
non-Hermitian \(M_2\) exists; arbitrary nonlinear or set-theoretic codes are
still not excluded.

The narrow faithful-representation obstruction does **not** obstruct the
lattice. A binary label plus the live qubit has faithful representation
Hilbert dimension \(2+2=4\), exactly two qubit sites. The three terminal
sectors have minimal faithful representation dimension \(2+2+2=6\), which
fits in three qubit sites including the live system. The explicit
append-aware writer in Section 3 instead uses three memory qubits plus the
live system—four qubit factors—because it retains an additional
residual-occupancy flag. Multisite capacity is therefore sufficient, and is
necessary only for the claimed faithful simultaneous
complex-linear/\(*\)-algebraic representation. The construction never asks
one classical label site to copy an unknown qubit state.

The Block-6 single-code map remains an exact fixed-preparation abstract
calibration. It is not a faithful operational representation of the full
preparation-dependent cq algebra. Restricted-family, real-affine, nonlinear,
and set-theoretic one-site routes remain live outside the negative theorem.
This correction prevents a hidden no-broadcasting/type error while preserving
the fixed theorem.

## 6. Effect-Complete Algebraic Tomography

Use the four density preparations

\[
 I/2,\qquad (I+X)/2,\qquad (I+Y)/2,\qquad (I+Z)/2.       \tag{14}
\]

Their coordinates against \(\{I,X,Y,Z\}\) have rank four. If an affine front
law has \(q_0(\rho)=\operatorname{Tr}(F_0\rho)\), equality with the writer's
retained label statistics on all four preparations solves uniquely to

\[
 F_0=E_0.                                                \tag{15}
\]

The executable applies the same solve to every branch of both A/B menus, not
only the shared front example (15). The label-projector-times-
\(\{I,X,Y,Z\}\) observables then separate each diagonal conditional branch
map algebraically.
To certify the cq structure itself rather than assume it, label off-diagonal
matrix units—or, at a binary stage, label \(X/Y\) times the system Pauli
basis—must also vanish. The runner uses the coherent pre-forgetting pointer
state as a hostile control: it has identical label-projector data and is
detected by the label-\(X/Y\) observables. This is the smallest simple qubit
tomography used here; the claim is spanning algebraic sufficiency, not
experimental optimality or a derived physical measurement interface.

A strong hostile control is the positive normalized wrong-effect POVM

\[
 F'_0={3\over10}I,\qquad F'_1={7\over10}I.              \tag{16}
\]

Let

\[
 \tau_j^*=
 {K_j\rho_*K_j^\dagger\over
  \operatorname{Tr}(K_j^\dagger K_j\rho_*)},\qquad
 \Phi'_j(\rho)=\operatorname{Tr}(F'_j\rho)\tau_j^* .
\]

The direct-sum measure-prepare channel
\(\Phi'=\bigoplus_j\Phi'_j\) is affine, CP, and trace preserving: its branch
Choi matrices are \((F'_j)^T\otimes\tau_j^*\geq0\), and
\(\sum_jF'_j=I\). It reproduces the complete front cq state at \(\rho_*\),
not merely its weights, but it fails (14). The Block-6 free weights are kept
as a separate pointwise \(\rho_*\) comparison; state-dependent branch
renormalization is not called an affine channel. A state-rotation spoof with
correct label weights passes label-only checks and fails a retained
label-times-\(Z\) observable. The executable tests all three controls and
checks the affinity and Choi positivity of \(\Phi'\).

Thus one preparation or labels alone are insufficient. The writer plus a
spanning preparation set, diagonal label-times-Pauli separating functionals,
and off-diagonal label controls is algebraically effect-complete and
state-retaining. A physical deployment must separately supply or derive the
corresponding preparation and measurement interface.

## 7. Supplied Randomization And Algebraic Tag Screening

For supplied preparations \(\rho_x=(I+X)/2\) and
\(\rho_z=(I+Z)/2\), a fair tagged preparation has joint state

\[
 \tau_{TS}={1\over2}|0\rangle\!\langle0|\otimes\rho_x
           +{1\over2}|1\rangle\!\langle1|\otimes\rho_z. \tag{17}
\]

The supplied tag-forgetting channel gives the direct system preparation

\[
 \operatorname{Tr}_T\tau_{TS}={\rho_x+\rho_z\over2}.    \tag{18}
\]

Linearity of the explicitly constructed channel, rather than an assumed
probability formula, yields

\[
 \Gamma_c((\rho_x+\rho_z)/2)
 ={1\over2}\Gamma_c(\rho_x)+{1\over2}\Gamma_c(\rho_z)  \tag{19}
\]

for every retained label-times-Pauli observable and both contexts. The tag,
its fair preparation, and the forgetting/export operation are named inputs;
host-side forgetting is not hidden. This closes only the algebraic affinity
test within the supplied screening channel; it is not a derived physical
Admissibility/Record equivalence. Autonomous randomizer genesis and a
framework-derived operational quotient remain open.

## 8. Central Restriction And The Separated Remaining Data

For label projector \(Z_j=|j\rangle\!\langle j|\otimes I\), equation (5)
gives

\[
 \operatorname{Tr}[Z_j\Gamma_c(\rho)]
   =\operatorname{Tr}(K_{cj}\rho K_{cj}^\dagger)
   =\operatorname{Tr}(K_{cj}^\dagger K_{cj}\rho).       \tag{20}
\]

No `q_j` is inserted into the writer. The numbers in (20) are the restriction
of the normalized cq state to its commutative label center.

The remaining probability-law seam contains this sharply typed compatibility
datum:

> **Central-restriction compatibility.** At a physically realized typed
> instrument port, the probability state prescribed by Admissibility on the
> already registered label-event algebra equals the restriction to the label
> center of the normalized label-retaining local channel state.

If this datum is supplied, (11), (15), and the Block-6 sector lemma force the
trace weights and exclude the displayed free and wrong-effect laws. It does
not by itself form or type a Record and it does not select or correlate an
actual history.

Two further claims remain logically separate:

- **stable-pointer/Record formation:** local dynamics must establish the
  label algebra as a formed permanent Record rather than a supplied memory
  basis; and
- **actual-history correlation:** the formed central atom must be related to
  the pointwise realized history without importing a sampler or identifying a
  block-diagonal ensemble with one member.

But current axiom wording does not supply this compatibility. It also does not
select the fresh fragments, their genesis, the staged interaction/schedule,
the site of formation, or a physical time map. The displayed datum is a
**sufficient candidate law/axiom interface**, not a proven necessary or
minimal axiom and not an authorized amendment. A retained microscopic local
dynamics plus stable-pointer/Record theorem could derive it without changing
the axioms. That possible derivation would still have to respect the separate
actual-history boundary.

## 9. No-Go Discipline Gate

Section 5 contains a negative capacity result, so the current no-go discipline
is applied. The quantified target is only a faithful complex-linear or
\(*\)-algebraic representation of the full binary or ternary state-retaining
cq algebra inside one \(M_2\) site.
Universal measurement impossibility, multisite writer impossibility,
stochastic-path impossibility, collapse impossibility, and axiom necessity are
outside the result and are `FAIL / DO NOT SHIP`.

### N1 — Alternative-route enumeration

| normalized route family | exact attempt and outcome | direct locator / authority status | honesty marker |
|---|---|---|---|
| one-site complex-linear injection | the full binary and ternary algebra coordinate maps would inject complex dimensions \(8\) or \(12\) into \(4\); both fail by rank | Section 5 and primary `multisite-cq-capacity-boundary`; proposal evidence | **ATTEMPTED** |
| one-site full \(*\)-homomorphism | faithfulness implies complex-linear injectivity, so the dimension test rejects it; equivalently the direct-sum central sector structure cannot be faithfully represented inside simple \(M_2\) | Section 5; finite algebra theorem, audit unset | **ATTEMPTED** |
| normalized-state real-affine code | the explicit seven-coordinate map \(\Phi(A\oplus B)\) injects binary normalized cq states into non-Hermitian \(M_2\); it succeeds as a raw code but fails \(*\), products, positivity/order, and observable-algebra preservation | Section 5 and both capacity runners; proposal evidence | **ATTEMPTED** |
| fixed-\(\rho_*\) Block-6 code | `kappa(sigma,j)` exactly encodes every tested subnormalized branch and label at the fixed fixture; it succeeds on that restricted family and is not promoted to a channel | [Block 6 sections 2 and 7](INSTRUMENT_PORT_TYPED_RECORD_COMPILER_CONDITIONAL_COMPLETION_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-20.md#2-exact-typed-port) and Section 4; proposal authority only | **ATTEMPTED** |
| binary multisite direct-sum carrier | a label qubit plus live system faithfully represents \(M_2\oplus M_2\), and the copied-pointer reduction succeeds exactly | equations (8)-(9), primary and independent runners; audit unset | **ATTEMPTED** |
| terminal three-site algebraic carrier | a two-qubit label register plus live system has Hilbert dimension \(8\geq6\), so a faithful terminal \(M_2^{\oplus3}\) representation succeeds without a residual-occupancy flag | Section 5 capacity count; algebraic carrier only | **ATTEMPTED** |
| four-site flagged append writer | three memory qubits plus the live system distinguish `000`, `110`, and `111`, preserve the front prefix, and realize the exact flat Kraus blocks; it succeeds with an explicit residual-occupancy flag | Section 3 and both staged-isometry checks; no physical Record authority | **ATTEMPTED** |

The successful real-affine and restricted-family one-site routes disprove any
broad one-site-code no-go. The successful multisite routes disprove any broad
writer or measurement no-go.

### N2 — Wall-independence audit

For the exact negative capacity target, the three load-bearing walls are:

- `W_L`: require a faithful complex-linear/\(*\)-algebraic
  representation rather than an arbitrary code;
- `W_F`: require the full simultaneous cq algebra rather than a fixed
  preparation or restricted family; and
- `W_S`: require the codomain to be one \(M_2\) site rather than a
  multisite carrier.

| directional pair | relaxing first automatically relaxes second? | relaxing second automatically relaxes first? | independent? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `W_L`, `W_F` | no — finite-dimensional full cq algebras and one \(M_2\) have the same continuum cardinality, so a set-theoretic one-site injection exists without preserving algebra | no — restricting to one \(M_2\) sector permits the identity complex-linear \(*\)-representation | yes |
| `W_L`, `W_S` | no — the real-affine binary code remains one-site | no — the multisite direct-sum representation remains complex-linear and \(*\)-faithful | yes |
| `W_F`, `W_S` | no — restricting to one sector permits the identity one-site representation | no — the multisite carrier represents the full cq algebra | yes |

These six directions show that the capacity conclusion disappears when any
one of the stated target conditions is relaxed; none is rhetoric for another.

The broader TOE residual ledger is separate from this capacity no-go:

- central-restriction compatibility with Admissibility;
- stable-pointer typing and local Record formation;
- autonomous apparatus/program selection;
- fresh-fragment genesis;
- overlap and interaction scheduling;
- actual-history correlation; and
- physical time/rate calibration.

No pairwise independence theorem for that broader ledger is smuggled into the
one-site capacity result. In particular, the realized-state primitive removes
the need for a new empty “actuality slot,” but does not derive the physical
actual-history correlation.

### N3 — Hidden-wall scan

The trigger scan covers “we assume,” “by construction,” “as is standard,”
“the framework provides,” “background,” “naturally,” “obviously,” and
“standard QFT.” Every load-bearing appearance is either absent or qualified as
an input. “Canonical cq channel” means equation (5), not a grant of framework
authority.

The note and executables name the programs, state semantics, fresh blanks,
copy gates, discrete ordering, preloaded apparatus, fixed calibration,
tomographic preparations, formal separating observables, tag state, and
tag-forgetting operation. No hidden sampler, random seed, observed branch,
clock, formation site, reset stream, physical measurement interface, or
universal state-dependent one-site code channel is used. The real-affine map
is explicitly a mathematical counterroute, not a physical channel.

### N4 — Per-citation residual matching

| cited witness (path, line) | residual attacked there | residual used here | match? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `docs/MINIMAL_AXIOMS_2026-06-29.md:55-83,116-135,153-169` | one local distribution and fixed Records; values, formation dynamics, and time withheld | authority boundary for central compatibility, Record formation, and time | yes — authority scope only |
| `docs/REALIZED_STATE_PRIMITIVE_NOTE_2026-06-11.md:12-50` | pointwise realized-state reference with no selection rule or contingent content | prevents inventing a new actuality slot while preserving the actual-history correlation residual | yes — primitive scope only |
| `docs/INSTRUMENT_PORT_TYPED_RECORD_COMPILER_CONDITIONAL_COMPLETION_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-20.md:441-492,753-787` | fixed-preparation typed histories and conditional cq ensemble equality | exact fresh-writer channel and fixed calibration | yes; proposal input, recomputed locally |
| `docs/RECORD_FORMATION_CONTROLLED_COPY_WRITE_ISOMETRY_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-06-18.md:12-63,127-157` | controlled pointer label copying on a fresh fragment | orthogonal label-copy component only | yes as historical unaudited prior art; exact matrices are rebuilt |
| `docs/PERSISTENT_RECORD_INSTRUMENT_CONSTRUCTION_NARROW_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-05-22.md:12-75` | block-column isometry for a supplied Kraus family | finite isometry grammar only | yes as historical conditional prior art; physical selection is not transferred |

No Stinespring or controlled-copy source is used as authority for branch
selection, Born probability, Record formation, or time.

### N5 — Resolution And Rhetoric

The primary runner emits these exact resolution lines:

```text
per_element: checked — exact Kraus operators, branch operators, label projectors, postbranch Pauli observables, and typed fixed-preparation code calibration remain separately typed
per_site: checked — fresh blank label fragments, controlled orthogonal label copy, faithful complex-linear full-cq-algebra one-M2 capacity failure, and supplied Record-typing boundary are explicit
per_mode: checked — coherent isometry, pointer-forgotten cq channel, central restriction, wrong-effect affine measure-prepare law, pointwise free-weight comparison, and realized atom remain distinct
per_block: checked — common binary front, delayed A/B residual isometries, append-only path prefixes, flat ternary channel intertwiner, and four-preparation tomography compose exactly
lattice_wide: checked and not executed — finite fresh-fragment blocks fit qubit-lattice capacity, while autonomous fragment genesis, local formation/typing, overlap scheduling, and physical time remain open
```

Every negative use is qualified by “faithful,” “complex-linear or
\(*\)-algebraic,” “full cq algebra,” and “one \(M_2\) site.” Universal
impossibility and axiom necessity are
`FAIL / DO NOT SHIP`.

### N6 — Partial-closure path scan

| route | positive closure now | exact residual |
|---|---|---|
| delayed instrument composition | exact common-front/residual factorization for A and B | program/apparatus selection remains supplied |
| binary fresh-ancilla writer | exact coherent and pointer-forgotten cq stages with copied orthogonal labels | stable Record typing and fresh-capacity genesis |
| algebraic terminal carrier | three qubit sites including the live system suffice for a faithful ternary cq representation | no residual-occupancy flag or autonomous writer is thereby supplied |
| flagged append writer | four qubit factors realize the exact path blocks and explicitly distinguish absent from written residual labels | the extra occupancy flag is not proved minimal or physically Record-forming |
| cq/Record ensemble equality | exact channel decoder plus fixed rho* typed calibration | identify channel center with Admissibility on a rich physical domain |
| effect identity | four spanning preparations force every A/B branch effect | physical preparation and measurement interface remains supplied |
| preparation affinity | exact under the displayed tag-forgetting channel | autonomous randomizer and lawful operational quotient |
| actuality | Record and realized-state primitives provide the target types | physical channel-to-formed-atom correlation remains open |
| real-affine one-site code | exact injective identifier for normalized binary cq states | no \(*\), product, positivity/order, or observable-algebra preservation |

The partial closures make an axiom update less, not more, urgent: a local
stable-pointer derivation could still close the compatibility datum.

### N7 — Strongest Steelman

The strongest counterroute to the negative capacity claim is the explicit
real-affine binary code in Section 5. It retains all seven normalized-state
coordinates in one non-Hermitian \(M_2\), so any statement that one site
cannot carry the information is false. What it does not retain is exactly the
claimed physical algebraic structure: products, \(*\), positivity/order, and
cq observables. Restricted-family, nonlinear, and set-theoretic routes remain
live as well. The negative theorem therefore cannot be widened.

The strongest positive alternative for the broader TOE seam is that no new
foundation axiom is needed. A microscopic covariant local update could select
the displayed instrument, derive a dynamically stable pointer/Record algebra,
and prove that the local predictive state restricts to that center. Controlled
fresh-fragment copying would then give (11), while the actual-history
correlation would remain a separately typed claim. This route is compatible
with every exact result in this block and is the next constructive target.

The strongest case for an explicit update is pragmatic rather than necessary:
if the program intends the quantum channel state to be the framework's
Admissibility state, leaving that interface unwritten permits the exact free
and wrong-effect counterlaws. Section 8 gives narrow sufficient wording for
that law-equality interface only; it does not bundle Record formation or
actual-member correlation into an owner-approved update.

### N8 — Cross-Cycle Echo

The earlier controlled-copy and persistent-instrument rows already separated
isometry algebra from physical Record selection. Cycle 334 separated a
coherent environment export, its dephased state, a decoder, and an actual
member. Block 6 separated typed code support from cq ensemble equality. The
present result composes the positive algebra those cycles left separate and
finds the same surviving seams: physical central-law compatibility,
stable-Record formation, and actual-history correlation, not another pointer
matrix or decoder.

## 10. Axiom And TOE Decision

No axiom amendment is justified yet. Section 8 identifies exact candidate
wording, but N1 and N7 leave a live derivation route through a local
stable-pointer dynamics. Owner authorization would also be required before
any canonical edit.

Audit status: none.  
Retained status: none.  
Obligation retirement: zero.  
TOE percentage movement: zero.

The frozen lane map remains:

| lane | repo science | physical M2 bridge | autonomous closure | evidence ceiling |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| operational quantum / Records | 95% | 92% | 50% | 99% |
| causal / time | 76% | 72% | 41% | 99% |
| inertia / matter | 95% | 96% | 75% | 99% |
| gravity / source / resources | 70% | 45% | 29% | 94% |
| Born / probability / realized history | 84% | 63% | 34% | 99% |

Science significance without score inflation:

1. the exact Block-6 cq ensemble equality is no longer a free algebraic
   equality inside the supplied fresh-instrument model;
2. a concrete probability-independent writer/intertwiner now exists;
3. one-preparation and label-only false closures have exact hostile controls;
4. the faithful complex-linear/\(*\)-algebraic one-site limitation is repaired
   by explicit multisite carriers, while a real-affine one-site counterroute
   prevents a broader no-go;
5. central-law equality, stable Record formation, and actual-history
   correlation are now separated rather than bundled as an undifferentiated
   “measurement problem.”

The next highest-leverage test is to derive central-restriction compatibility
and, separately, stable Record typing from one local microscopic update on
this exact fixture. Keep actual-member correlation outside that theorem. Kill
the route if it merely declares the pointer basis, invokes trace weights as a
sampler, or calls the dephased cq state an actual atom.
