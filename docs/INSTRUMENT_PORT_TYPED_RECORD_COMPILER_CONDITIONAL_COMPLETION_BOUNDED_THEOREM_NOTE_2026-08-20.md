claim_scope: "For the exact supplied Block-4 common {K0,B} stage, preparation rho*=diag(3/5,2/5), and delayed A/B residual programs, one M2(C) Record code C=kappa(Sigma,j) admits distinct exact state and apparatus-relative rail projections. With these projections, C0 seals the continuation while CB alone opens the proper context-specific residual stage, and its Hermitian part is sufficient for the exact residual CP update. Three pairwise-disjoint proper-cubic shell-orbit guards, multiplied by the exact typed-stage predicate, extend this adapter to a supplied total Borel nearest-neighbour formation/content law; typed-near and untyped continuation spoofs have zero formation probability. In its trace-matched specialization, the complete permanent Record-history weights equal the supplied flat ternary Kraus-instrument trace weights exactly; a support-identical free-weight specialization gives different normalized histories. A sectorwise ensemble-consistency lemma proves that the trace weights are the unique weights reproducing the normalized auxiliary cq instrument state from the same normalized conditional branch states, but the physical ensemble-consistency premise is supplied rather than derived. Thus a conditional positive instrument-to-Record completion exists, the earlier code/rail mismatch and eager-stage defect are removed, and the remaining numerical seam is the physical instrument-ensemble/Record-ensemble identification plus formation and contingent actuality. Separately, an affine CPTP map whose normalized output is pointwise confined to one of two orthogonal Record sectors for every input must choose one constant sector; coherent copy and dephasing therefore do not by themselves yield a nontrivial definite atom. This is an affine deterministic class boundary, not a universal measurement no-go. The compiler, preparation, apparatus, trace-instrument semantics, typed orbit gates, initial state, formation kernel, discrete synchronous step order, and conditional independence are supplied. No physical time, seed genesis, Born derivation from the axioms, contingent actual outcome, axiom amendment, audit verdict, or obligation retirement is claimed."

## 1. Result Up Front

Block 5 exposed two concrete defects in its otherwise lawful support model:

1. its complement branch-operator code
   `CB=kappa(SigmaB,1)` is not literally the Block-4 complement-effect rail
   `RB=kappa(I-E0,1)`; and
2. its generic occupied-neighbour formation gate can enable the residual site
   before the front event has formed.

Both defects are repaired here without enlarging the one-site possibility
algebra and without equating different matrices. Define two typed projections
of a declared port code `C`:

\[
  S(C)={C+C^\dagger\over2},\qquad
  d_M(C_j)=\kappa(E_j,j),                              \tag{1}
\]

where `M={E0,I-E0}` is the fixed supplied front apparatus and
`C_j=kappa(Sigma_j,j)`. The first projection carries the preparation-dependent
positive branch operator. The second is an apparatus-relative compiler into
the event/rail role. In particular,

\[
  C_B\ne R_B,\qquad S(C_B)=\Sigma_B,\qquad d_M(C_B)=R_B. \tag{2}
\]

The continuation decoder requires both the complement rail role and the exact
state payload. Consequently:

```text
initial apparatus       -> only s0 is active
s0 appends C0           -> no residual continuation
s0 appends CB           -> only the context-specific s1 is active
s0 appends bare RB      -> no residual continuation
s1 appends terminal Cjr -> no further declared active site.
```

The bare effect rail is deliberately rejected because its Hermitian part is
`I-E0`, not `SigmaB`. The typed code is therefore neither a relabelled effect
nor a normalized density state. It is one `M2(C)` possibility carrying an
unnormalized positive state payload plus a declared apparatus-relative role.

The exact A/B residual CP operators act on `S(CB)=SigmaB` and reproduce all
four terminal positive branch operators. The earlier local code/geometry
obstruction is therefore closed conditionally.

Three disjoint 24-shell proper-cubic orbit guards—front, continuation A, and
continuation B—multiplied by the same exact typed-stage predicate then give a
total local Borel Record kernel. Two
specializations share exactly the same code support, projections, stage
topology, formation sites, permanent histories, apparatus, and covariance:

- `L_trace` uses the supplied quantum-instrument trace weights;
- `L_free` uses unrelated positive normalized weights.

For `L_trace`, the terminal Record histories have weights

\[
  A:(3/10,19/50,8/25),\qquad
  B:(3/10,7/20,7/20),                                \tag{3}
\]

exactly equal to the three flat Kraus-branch traces for the supplied
preparation. This is a **conditional positive completion** from the staged
instrument measure to a permanent Record history.

The free-weight law has identical support and stages but different normalized
history weights. Therefore the exact datum still missing from current
foundation authority is:

> **Instrument-measure/Record-measure identification.** For a physically
> compiled local instrument and preparation, the conditional Admissibility
> measure on the declared Record codes is the pushforward of the instrument's
> outcome measure under the typed code compiler, together with an actual
> local formation/commitment transition.

The displayed completion supplies that identification; it does not derive it
from the axioms. A sectorwise ensemble-consistency lemma below shows that the
trace weights become unique once exact equality to the auxiliary cq instrument
state is imposed. Deriving that physical equality is still the bridge, not a
consequence of the algebra alone. In particular, this is **not a pointwise actualization theorem**
for coherent unitary evolution. A separate exact affine-class result below
shows why copy, environment export, or dephasing alone cannot supply a
nontrivial definite atom for every input.

This is significant route progress but not retained TOE closure. Audit status
is none. Retained status is none. Zero obligation retirement. TOE percentage
movement: zero. No axiom amendment is justified by this block.

## 2. Exact Typed Port

Keep the supplied Block-4 data

\[
 E_0=\begin{pmatrix}1/2&0\\0&0\end{pmatrix},\quad
 E_B=I-E_0=\begin{pmatrix}1/2&0\\0&1\end{pmatrix},
\]

\[
 \rho_*=\operatorname{diag}(3/5,2/5),\quad
 \Sigma_0=\operatorname{diag}(3/10,0),\quad
 \Sigma_B=\operatorname{diag}(3/10,2/5).             \tag{4}
\]

For `R in M2(C)`, define

\[
 S(R)={R+R^\dagger\over2},\qquad
 \ell(R)={1\over2}\operatorname{Im}\operatorname{Tr}R,
\]

\[
 A_0(R)={R-R^\dagger\over2i}-\ell(R)I_2.             \tag{5}
\]

The declared port-code surface consists of codes with `A0(R)=0` and positive
`S(R)`. Thus a typed code has exactly the form `S+i ell I`. The traceless
anti-Hermitian component is forbidden rather than silently ignored. On the
two front labels, the apparatus-relative rail compiler is

\[
 d_M(R)=
 \begin{cases}
   \kappa(E_0,0),&\ell(R)=0,\\
   \kappa(E_B,1),&\ell(R)=1,\\
   \bot,&\text{otherwise}.
 \end{cases}                                         \tag{6}
\]

Equation (6) is a supplied compiler tied to the fixed apparatus `M`. It is not
an intrinsic map from `SigmaB` to `EB`, and it is not inferred from matrix
equality. This apparatus dependence is essential: the same positive operator
could occur under another effect menu with a different rail role.

The two front atoms obey

| code | state projection | rail projection | role |
|---|---|---|---|
| `C0=kappa(Sigma0,0)` | `Sigma0` | `R0=kappa(E0,0)` | terminal front branch |
| `CB=kappa(SigmaB,1)` | `SigmaB` | `RB=kappa(EB,1)` | residual-enabled branch |

Both literal inequalities `C0 != R0` and `CB != RB` are checked. A hostile
code obtained by adding `i diag(1,-1)` to `CB` has the same scalar label but
nonzero `A0`; it is rejected. The bare `RB` has the correct rail projection
but the wrong state projection and is also rejected by the continuation.

This is an exact local typing repair. It does not require a second live
state register, does not read blank content, and does not smuggle the effect
matrix into the Hermitian branch-state slot.

## 3. Delayed Nearest-Neighbour Geometry

Reuse the exact Block-4 two-target layout. At `s0`, the predecessor is the
preparation Record and the other four occupied neighbours are the common
markers. The sixth neighbour `s1` is blank. The remote context is graph
distance two from `s0` and graph distance one from `s1`.

At `s1`, five occupied neighbours are required. Its predecessor at `s0` must
satisfy simultaneously

\[
 d_M(C)=R_B,\qquad S(C)=\Sigma_B.                    \tag{7}
\]

The transverse neighbours must be the three residual markers plus exactly
context A or B. The one remaining neighbour is blank. This gives the exact
stage decoder

```text
preparation + common markers                       -> front
typed complement role + SigmaB + residuals + A    -> continuation-A
typed complement role + SigmaB + residuals + B    -> continuation-B.
```

Because `s0` is blank initially, `s1` has only four occupied neighbours and
cannot be active. After `C0`, condition (7) fails by rail role. After bare
`RB`, it fails by state payload. After `CB`, both clauses hold. Appending a
terminal code occupies `s1`, so permanence prevents replay there.

The runner enumerates every frontier site of the supplied finite apparatus,
not only the intended targets. Initially the only nonzero formation support is
`s0`; after `CB` it is only `s1`; after `C0` or a terminal result there is
none. Thus the completion removes Block 5's eager-occupancy defect rather than
merely adding a decoder beside it.

Every dependency is a current nearest neighbour. Rotating the relative slots
through the 24 proper cubic rotations and translating the target carries the
same rule. No internal unitary co-action on the `M2(C)` contents is claimed.

## 4. Exact Positive Branch-State Tree

The four terminal unnormalized positive operators are

\[
 \Sigma_{A1}=\begin{pmatrix}
  19/450&19\sqrt2/225\\19\sqrt2/225&76/225
 \end{pmatrix},\quad
 \Sigma_{A2}=\begin{pmatrix}
  16/75&-8\sqrt2/75\\-8\sqrt2/75&8/75
 \end{pmatrix},                                      \tag{8}
\]

\[
 \Sigma_{B1}=\begin{pmatrix}
  7/60&7\sqrt2/60\\7\sqrt2/60&7/30
 \end{pmatrix},\quad
 \Sigma_{B2}=\begin{pmatrix}
  7/60&-7\sqrt2/60\\-7\sqrt2/60&7/30
 \end{pmatrix}.                                     \tag{9}
\]

All are nonzero positive rank-one matrices. Give them terminal labels
`2,3,4,5` and codes

\[
 C_{A1}=\kappa(\Sigma_{A1},2),\quad
 C_{A2}=\kappa(\Sigma_{A2},3),\quad
 C_{B1}=\kappa(\Sigma_{B1},4),\quad
 C_{B2}=\kappa(\Sigma_{B2},5).                       \tag{10}
\]

Let `J_Ar,J_Br` be the exact residual operators from the Block-4
factorization. The executable reconstructs them independently from the full
ternary Kraus programs and checks

\[
 J_{Mr}\Sigma_BJ_{Mr}^\dagger
   =K_{Mr}\rho_*K_{Mr}^\dagger
   =\Sigma_{Mr},\qquad M\in\{A,B\}.                  \tag{11}

All numerical reconstruction residuals are below `9e-11`; the target
matrices, positivity, rank, and trace arithmetic are exact symbolic checks.
No normalized branch state is substituted for the unnormalized operator.

Their traces are

\[
 \operatorname{Tr}\Sigma_0=3/10,\quad
 \operatorname{Tr}\Sigma_B=7/10,
\]

\[
 (\operatorname{Tr}\Sigma_{A1},\operatorname{Tr}\Sigma_{A2})
  =(19/50,8/25),
\]

\[
 (\operatorname{Tr}\Sigma_{B1},\operatorname{Tr}\Sigma_{B2})
  =(7/20,7/20).                                      \tag{12}
\]

The A and B terminal trace triples each sum to one. Conditional on the
complement port, their trace ratios are `(19/35,16/35)` and `(1/2,1/2)`.
These values will be used by one supplied specialization below; equation (12)
does not grant the trace rule axiom authority.

## 5. Locked-Output Interface Without A Type Error

For the supplied two-effect front instrument, let `P0,PB` be orthogonal
projectors on an auxiliary classical label register. The rank-one
locked-output normal form gives the CP outcome operations

\[
 \mathcal W_j(\rho)=\operatorname{Tr}(E_j\rho)P_j.   \tag{13}
\]

Their sum is trace preserving because `E0+EB=I`. Their outputs are confined
to orthogonal label sectors. At `rho*`, the label-register density is
`diag(3/10,7/10)`.

The Record code is not the density matrix output of (13). A supplied classical
calibration maps label `j` to `C_j`; the state and rail projections of that
code then feed the lattice rule. This respects the existing classicalization
firewall:

```text
pre-record state/instrument
    -> auxiliary outcome-label operation
    -> typed code calibration
    -> permanent Record append.
```

Equation (13) is a valid CP instrument operation and the codes are valid
`M2(C)` possibilities, but identifying the label outcome measure with the
Admissibility measure is an extra physical bridge. Calling `C_j` itself a
density matrix would be a type error because its imaginary scalar label makes
it non-Hermitian. Calling the unconditioned diagonal label state one realized
atom would be another type error.

The calibration in this block is valid only for the fixed `rho*`, apparatus,
and program: it reattaches the precomputed branch payload `Sigma_j` after the
label-only map (13). It is not a generic state-retaining instrument channel.
The natural generic comparison object for the next block is instead

\[
 \Gamma(\rho)=\bigoplus_j K_j\rho K_j^\dagger,
\]

with auxiliary label sector, conditional quantum state, and non-Hermitian
Record code kept as three distinct types.

## 6. Total Local Covariant Completion

Let a shell be the complete six-neighbour condition, with each slot either
blank or one `M2(C)` content. Let `eta_F,eta_A,eta_B` be the exact front,
continuation-A, and continuation-B shells. Let `O_r` be each shell's
24-element proper-cubic slot orbit. Let `g_r(eta)` be one exactly when the
shell-level decoder in section 3 assigns stage `r`, and zero otherwise. Its
equality fibers are closed in each finite-dimensional occupancy stratum, so
`g_r` is Borel.

For equal occupancy patterns, use squared Hilbert--Schmidt distance to an
orbit as in Block 5 and set

\[
 b_r(\eta)=\max\{0,1-D(\eta,O_r)/(1/64)\}.           \tag{14}
\]

For unequal occupancy patterns set the bump to zero. The closest A/B
continuation orbits have squared separation `3`; the front orbit is much
farther away. Since `3>4(1/64)`, the three ambient Hilbert--Schmidt guards are
pairwise disjoint. Define

\[
 \widetilde b_r(\eta)=g_r(\eta)b_r(\eta).           \tag{15}
\]

Hence at most one typed bump is nonzero. The exact decoder uses equality of
the preparation, marker, state-payload, and rail data, so the nonzero
formation support consists of the 72 guarded orbit shells; the ambient
positive-width bumps are distance guards, not positive-width formation
patches. In particular, replacing the continuation predecessor by either
`CB+(1/64)I` or `CB+i(1/64)diag(1,-1)` leaves it close to the orbit but makes
every typed bump zero. The first mutation has the right rail and wrong state
payload; the second has forbidden anti-Hermitian slack.

Use the same condition-dependent full-support Gaussian `gamma_eta` as Block
5 outside the finite guarded support. For model `m`, stage `r`, and atom measure
`nu_(m,r)`, define

\[
 K_m(\eta)=
 \begin{cases}
 \widetilde b_r(\eta)\nu_{m,r}+(1-\widetilde b_r(\eta))\gamma_\eta,
   &\widetilde b_r(\eta)>0,\\
 \gamma_\eta,&\widetilde b_F=\widetilde b_A=\widetilde b_B=0,
 \end{cases}                                         \tag{16}
\]

and formation probability

\[
 q(\eta)=\widetilde b_F(\eta)+\widetilde b_A(\eta)
          +\widetilde b_B(\eta).                    \tag{17}
\]

At an occupied site the transition is the Dirac measure at its existing
content. At a blank site the combined kernel puts mass `1-q` on blank and
mass `q K_m` on new content. Equations (14)-(17) define a normalized Borel
kernel for every complete shell and preserve existing Records. They are
translation covariant and proper-cubic slot covariant. The Gaussian center
varies with the full shell, so the off-guard law is not a constant placeholder.

On the exact supplied apparatus, `q=1` only at the unique typed target at each
stage. The Gaussian branch is never used along the displayed exact histories.
It exists to make the law total and to provide current-support compatibility,
not to claim genesis of the preloaded apparatus.

Supplied fresh conditional independence across sites gives a countable
product one-step kernel on the standard-Borel Record-configuration space.
Ionescu--Tulcea then gives a path measure over supplied discrete steps
`n in N`. The step index is not physical time; synchrony, the initial
apparatus, and independence are inputs. No transfinite limit-stage kernel is
claimed.

## 7. Trace-Matched And Free-Weight Laws

The trace-matched atomic measures are

\[
 \nu_{t,F}={3\over10}\delta_{C_0}+{7\over10}\delta_{C_B},
\]

\[
 \nu_{t,A}={19\over35}\delta_{C_{A1}}
            +{16\over35}\delta_{C_{A2}},\qquad
 \nu_{t,B}={1\over2}\delta_{C_{B1}}
            +{1\over2}\delta_{C_{B2}}.              \tag{18}
\]

The permanent finite Record histories under (18) have the three terminal
masses displayed in equation (3). They equal the supplied full Kraus program
branch traces exactly. Thus, conditional on instrument trace semantics and
the identification clause, the staged Record law is end-to-end and
state-support faithful on the supplied preparation.

For the control law, use

\[
 \nu_{f,F}={2\over3}\delta_{C_0}+{1\over3}\delta_{C_B},
\]

\[
 \nu_{f,A}={3\over7}\delta_{C_{A1}}+{4\over7}\delta_{C_{A2}},\qquad
 \nu_{f,B}={4\over9}\delta_{C_{B1}}+{5\over9}\delta_{C_{B2}}. \tag{19}
\]

Every atom, decoder, rail role, state projection, formation site, stage,
permanence rule, guarded orbit support, and off-guard kernel is the same as in
(18).
Only the conditional atom weights differ. Both laws normalize. The free-weight
law therefore proves that typed support and exact stage composition do not
select trace matching under the current axioms.

### Sectorwise ensemble-consistency lemma

The numerical residual can be sharpened without pretending it is gone. At
any of the three stages, let the two nonzero branch operators be
`sigma_(rj)`, let

\[
 T_r=\sum_j\operatorname{Tr}\sigma_{rj},\qquad
 \rho_{rj}={\sigma_{rj}\over\operatorname{Tr}\sigma_{rj}},
\]

and put the auxiliary outcome labels in orthogonal sectors `P_j`. The
normalized nonselective classical-quantum instrument state and a candidate
ensemble made from the same normalized conditional states are

\[
 \Gamma_r={1\over T_r}\bigoplus_j\sigma_{rj},\qquad
 \Gamma_r(q)=\bigoplus_j q_{rj}\rho_{rj}.           \tag{20}
\]

If exact ensemble consistency `Gamma_r(q)=Gamma_r` is imposed, projection to
sector `j` followed by the trace gives

\[
 q_{rj}={\operatorname{Tr}\sigma_{rj}\over T_r}.    \tag{21}
\]

All fixture branches are nonzero, so the normalized conditional states are
defined and the solution is unique. For a zero block, sector trace equality
forces `q_j=0`; its normalized conditional state is undefined and that branch
must be omitted rather than divided by zero. Equation (21) gives `(3/10,7/10)` at the
front, `(19/35,16/35)` in residual context A, and `(1/2,1/2)` in residual
context B. The primary and independent runners solve the block-diagonal
matrix equalities exactly and verify that every corresponding free-weight
ensemble differs from `Gamma_r`.

This **sectorwise ensemble-consistency lemma** is conditional. It uses the
auxiliary cq nonselective state as the physical ensemble object, uses the same
normalized conditional branch states on the Record side, and requires the two
ensemble descriptions to be equal. It does not derive that equality from
Admissibility, does not turn auxiliary labels into `M2(C)` density states, and
does not select a contingent member. Without orthogonal retained labels, with
a zero branch, or without exact ensemble consistency, this uniqueness proof
does not apply. Thus the lemma converts “choose trace weights” into the
sharper obligation “derive physical cq-instrument/Record-ensemble
consistency.” Preparation mixing, operational equivalence, and a sufficiently
rich menu are candidate mechanisms for that derivation; they are not premises
silently granted here.

## 8. Affine Deterministic Definite-Atom Boundary

There is a second, sharply scoped issue: can ordinary linear evolution itself
replace the stochastic commitment law?

Let `Phi` be an affine trace-preserving map from density operators into a
carrier with two orthogonal Record sectors `P0` and `P1`. Impose the strong
pointwise-definiteness condition that, for every normalized input `rho`, the
whole output `Phi(rho)` is supported in exactly one of the sectors, although
the sector is initially allowed to depend on `rho`.

Suppose inputs `rho0,rho1` produced different sectors. For `0<t<1`, affinity
gives

\[
 \Phi(t\rho_0+(1-t)\rho_1)
   =t\Phi(\rho_0)+(1-t)\Phi(\rho_1).                 \tag{22}
\]

Both summands are nonzero normalized positive operators on orthogonal
sectors, so (22) has support in both sectors. That violates pointwise
definiteness. Therefore every such affine map has one constant sector
assignment.

This theorem allows fixed reset channels; they are explicit controls against
overclaiming. It rules out only a nontrivial deterministic affine channel that
always returns one definite branch-sensitive Record atom. It does not rule
out instruments, stochastic trajectories, hidden-variable models, nonlinear
dynamics, superselection with an already-supplied sector, or framework
Admissibility draws.

The branch-calibrated Stinespring isometry

\[
 V|\psi\rangle
 =|0\rangle K_0|\psi\rangle|c_0\rangle
  +|B\rangle B|\psi\rangle|c_B\rangle               \tag{23}
\]

where `|c_0>`, `|c_B>` are orthonormal auxiliary labels and a separate
classical calibration sends `c_j` to `C_j`. The `M2(C)` codes are not Hilbert
space kets. The output of (23) has both sectors for generic inputs. Tracing or
exactly dephasing the coherent
labels gives a classical-quantum mixture, not one pointwise actual atom.
Copying the label gives a larger correlated state with the same issue. Thus a
coherent pointer, decohered pointer, and permanent label correlation are not
by themselves the commitment operation required by the Record reading.

The positive law in sections 6-7 escapes this class boundary by being a
stochastic kernel over Record configurations. Its trace-matched version is a
conditional completion, not a derivation of stochastic actuality from a
unitary map.

## 9. Exact Remaining Datum And Axiom Decision

The campaign can now separate four seams:

| seam | Block-6 status |
|---|---|
| one-site state/rail code capacity | conditionally closed by `S` and `d_M` |
| delayed local stage topology | conditionally closed; exhaustive frontier check removes eager `s1` |
| support-faithful total Record law | explicitly constructed on exactly 72 guarded orbit shells in both specializations; off-guard formation is zero |
| numerical weights under cq ensemble consistency | uniquely forced sector by sector at all three stages |
| physical cq-instrument/Record-ensemble equality | supplied in `L_trace`, violated by `L_free`, and not derived |
| pointwise commitment from affine deterministic evolution | impossible only in the stated two-sector definite-output class |
| microscopic formation law, seed genesis, physical time, and observed actual member | separately open |

The narrow candidate downstream law is:

> Given a declared local instrument, preparation, and typed code compiler,
> the Record ensemble equals the code pushforward of the label-retaining cq
> instrument ensemble; a local formation kernel gives one-hot append semantics
> on each path while preserving prior Records; and an actuality rule identifies
> the observed path/member.

This statement combines ensemble identification, law-level formation, and
contingent actuality. It
is sufficient for the displayed trace-matched completion, but it is not
adopted, shown minimal, or shown to require a new foundation axiom. It may be
derivable as downstream physics from a canonical state-retaining instrument,
preparation affinity, operational equivalence, fresh-capacity dynamics, and
the already stated Admissibility/Record interfaces. Conversely, only after
those routes fail across a sufficiently rich family would any owner-grade
axiom decision be mature.

No axiom amendment follows today. One supplied positive completion and one
support-identical alternative establish compatibility and nonselection, not
axiom necessity.

## 10. No-Go Discipline Gate

The affine result in section 8 is negative, so the current no-go discipline
is applied before shipping. The target is the narrow deterministic affine
definite-output class. Universal impossibility, measurement impossibility,
collapse impossibility, failure of stochastic routes, and axiom necessity are
outside the claim.

### N1 — Alternative-route enumeration

| normalized route family | test | exact disposition and authority boundary | honesty marker |
|---|---|---|---|
| coherent Stinespring vector | attach orthonormal auxiliary labels to `K0,B` and demand one label sector | equation (23) is an exact isometry, but a generic vector occupies both sectors; the [current Record axiom](MINIMAL_AXIOMS_2026-06-29.md#record--fixed-reality) does not identify that pre-Record vector with one fixed Record | **ATTEMPTED** |
| dephased nonselective cq operator | erase label interference and demand one sector | exact dephasing yields the block-diagonal state in (20), with both nonzero blocks; the [Record firewall](RECORD_CLASSICALIZATION_DYNAMICS_FIREWALL_2026-06-05.md#4-dynamics-consequence) is unaudited prior art, so its ensemble/atom distinction is reproduced locally rather than used as retained proof | **ATTEMPTED** |
| redundant controlled-copy state | fan the orthogonal label into multiple fresh registers and demand selection by redundancy | exact controlled copies preserve the two correlated summands; redundancy changes neither sector support nor the locally re-proved distinction described in the historical [Record/ensemble firewall](RECORD_CLASSICALIZATION_DYNAMICS_FIREWALL_2026-06-05.md#3-probability-is-a-state-on-the-record-algebra-not-the-atom-itself) | **ATTEMPTED** |
| nonselective locked-output CP channel | sum the two maps `Tr(E_j rho)P_j` and demand a single locked output | locally checked effect bounds and Choi positivity give an affine two-sector mixture; the [locked-output normal form](RECORD_OBSERVABLE_QUOTIENT_AND_RANK_ONE_FORMATION_OUTCOME_OPERATION_NORMAL_FORM_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-07-11.md#4-rank-one-locked-output-outcome-operation-normal-form) is unaudited prior art and is not used as retained selection authority | **ATTEMPTED** |
| general deterministic affine writer | bypass a dilation and demand an input-dependent definite sector directly | equation (22) applies to the full affine class: mixing two inputs assigned to different sectors violates the pointwise-definite codomain; fixed reset remains the explicit control | **ATTEMPTED** |
| fixed reset channel | use a constant definite-output affine map | it succeeds only by choosing one constant sector and therefore confirms, rather than evades, the theorem's conclusion; the [Record axiom](MINIMAL_AXIOMS_2026-06-29.md#record--fixed-reality) does not supply branch fidelity for such a reset | **ATTEMPTED** |
| stochastic Record-path kernel | replace one deterministic output with a measure over one-hot append paths | sections 6-7 construct this escape exactly, so it defeats every broad no-go while lying outside the quantified deterministic affine class; a path measure still does not name the observed member | **ATTEMPTED** |
| preformed-branch adapter | start from an already definite `C0` or `CB` and compile its rail/state roles | the downstream adapter succeeds, but the [current axiom boundary](MINIMAL_AXIOMS_2026-06-29.md#open-gates-outside-the-axioms) leaves the extensional formation values open, so the route imports the target occurrence | **ATTEMPTED** |

Because a stochastic positive route is explicitly constructed, N1 forbids
any broad no-go. The deterministic affine theorem only explains why more
unitary/dephasing work is low leverage for the commitment seam.

### N2 — Wall-independence audit

The code/compiler and finite staged-support obligations are conditionally
closed, so they are not counted as open walls. The collapsed open set is:

- `W_E`: derive physical equality of the canonical cq instrument ensemble
  and the Admissibility/Record ensemble;
- `W_F`: derive a microscopic formation transition/path law on an available
  apparatus rather than supply the kernel;
- `W_G`: derive reachability of the preloaded apparatus and fresh capacity
  from a smaller lawful seed;
- `W_X`: identify a contingent observed path/member rather than only a path
  measure; and
- `W_T`: connect discrete update order to physical time.

| pair | closing first automatically closes second? | closing second automatically closes first? | independent? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `W_E`, `W_F` | no — ensemble equality does not generate the apparatus or transitions | no — a formation law can use the wrong ensemble weights | yes |
| `W_E`, `W_G` | no — ensemble equality does not construct the initial apparatus | no — apparatus genesis supplies no ensemble identity | yes |
| `W_E`, `W_X` | no — an exact ensemble still has no named observed member | no — a selector can sample the wrong measure | yes |
| `W_E`, `W_T` | no — measure equality supplies no clock | no — a clock supplies no probabilities | yes |
| `W_F`, `W_G` | no — a transition can be defined only on the preloaded apparatus | no — reaching the apparatus does not choose its formation transition | yes |
| `W_F`, `W_X` | no — a stochastic path law does not identify which path is observed | no — a member selector does not derive reachability dynamics | yes |
| `W_F`, `W_T` | no — discrete formation can exist without physical-time calibration | no — a calibrated clock does not generate the transition law | yes |
| `W_G`, `W_X` | no — apparatus reachability does not identify an observed branch | no — selecting a member does not prepare the apparatus | yes |
| `W_G`, `W_T` | no — a discrete preparation history need not be time-calibrated | no — a clock does not supply seed-to-apparatus reachability | yes |
| `W_X`, `W_T` | no — actual-member semantics supplies no time map | no — time calibration does not select a member | yes |

This corrects the tempting but false conflation of per-path one-hot semantics
with the identity of the contingent observed path, and it separates apparatus
genesis from formation and time. None of the ten directional tests collapses
the five-wall set.

### N3 — Hidden-wall scan

The literal trigger-family scan found no inferential use of “we assume,” “by
construction,” “as is standard,” “the framework provides,” “bridge context,”
“background,” “naturally,” “obviously,” or “standard QFT.” It found no
load-bearing “registered” or “canonical” shortcut; “canonical cq instrument”
below names the displayed block-diagonal map and does not grant it Record
authority.

The primary note and executable explicitly name all load-bearing supplied
inputs: `rho*`, the two effect menus, Kraus programs, residual factorization,
branch operators, apparatus-relative compiler, terminal labels, orbit radius,
exact typed-stage gate, Gaussian fallback, trace semantics in `L_trace`, free
weights in `L_free`, preloaded apparatus, discrete synchronous step order, and
fresh conditional independence. The fixed-preparation code calibration is not
called a quantum channel. The initial Records are checked only for current
compatibility; their genesis is not inferred. No blank matrix value,
host-selected branch, hidden random seed, or observed outcome is used.

### N4 — Per-citation residual matching

| cited witness (path, line) | residual attacked there | residual used here | match? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `docs/MINIMAL_AXIOMS_2026-06-29.md:55-83,153-169,208-214` | one local probability law and permanent supported content, with extensional formation data qualified | authority boundary for ensemble identification, formation, and actuality | yes — authority scope only |
| `docs/COMMON_FRONT_STAGE_REMOTE_CONTEXT_RECORD_EVENT_CONGRUENCE_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-20.md:80-119,398-425` | effect-label rail and separately supplied positive branch state are not integrated | typed state/rail compiler and exact residual continuation | yes |
| `docs/SHARED_EVENT_RECORD_SUPPORT_SELECTION_TRIANGLE_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-20.md:73-89,394-416` | eager generic gate and branch-code/continuation-rail mismatch | exact typed gate and state/rail projections | yes |
| `docs/RECORD_OBSERVABLE_QUOTIENT_AND_RANK_ONE_FORMATION_OUTCOME_OPERATION_NORMAL_FORM_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-07-11.md:193-236` | supplied-effect locked-output operation normal form | auxiliary selective label operation only | yes as unaudited prior art; effect bounds and Choi positivity are re-proved here, with no Record or selection transfer |
| `docs/RECORD_CLASSICALIZATION_DYNAMICS_FIREWALL_2026-06-05.md:42-51,120-180` | state, instrument ensemble, probability state, and realized atom have different types | excludes code/density and ensemble/actual-member conflation | yes as historical unaudited prior art; the needed distinctions are re-stated and checked locally |

The controlled-copy prior was dropped as a no-go witness because stable label
copying and contingent path selection are different residuals. The current
convexity proof is self-contained and does not count prior failure rhetoric as
evidence.

### N5 — Resolution and rhetoric

The primary runner emits these exact resolution lines:

```text
per_element: checked — exact positive branch operators, typed Hermitian state projection, apparatus-relative rail projection, anti-Hermitian spoof rejection, and non-Hermitian-code firewall
per_site: checked — unique initial front, delayed complement continuation, effect-rail rejection, permanent append, total shell kernel, and condition-varying Gaussian fallback
per_mode: checked — coherent Kraus possibility, locked-output label register, typed Record-code calibration, trace-matched law, and support-identical free-weight law remain distinct
per_block: checked — exact two-stage CP composition, three disjoint 24-shell orbit guards, proper-cubic slot covariance, typed-near/preemption controls, and normalized terminal histories
lattice_wide: checked and not executed — local Borel kernels admit the supplied discrete-step product/path extension; physical time, seed genesis, state-affinity authority, and contingent actualization remain open
```

The affine theorem is stated with “deterministic,” “affine,” “normalized
output,” “two orthogonal sectors,” and “pointwise definite for every input”
every time it is used inferentially. The gate is `FAIL / DO NOT SHIP` for a
universal impossibility, axiom necessity, or a claim that reset channels and
stochastic instruments are excluded.

### N6 — Partial-closure path scan

| route | positive closure available now | residual |
|---|---|---|
| typed code compiler | exact on the Block-4 program | apparatus-relative compiler is supplied |
| delayed Record rail | exact on A/B finite layouts and all carried slot frames | preloaded apparatus and finite program are supplied |
| sectorwise cq consistency | uniquely forces every displayed stage weight | physical equality of cq instrument and Record ensembles is supplied |
| preparation affinity/effect identification | can potentially derive that equality on a rich preparation/menu domain | affinity alone admits wrong normalized affine laws, so label-retaining operational equivalence is also needed |
| controlled-copy/locked-output writer | exact coherent or CP label interface | neither the nonselective ensemble nor redundancy identifies an observed member |
| microscopic repeated-interaction law | could derive formation, a quantum trajectory, and append-only memory without a new foundation axiom | no retained candidate yet; unraveling/actual-member semantics must be explicit |

This scan sets the next high-leverage target: physical equality of the
label-retaining cq instrument ensemble and the Record ensemble on a rich
preparation/menu domain, using preparation affinity as a tool rather than the
conclusion. A fresh-ancilla repeated-interaction/trajectory writer is co-equal
for the independent formation/actuality seam. Another fixed pointer or weight
tournament is low leverage.

### N7 — Strongest steelman

A physical repeated-interaction law could couple the canonical state-retaining
cq instrument to fresh Record capacity, prove operational equality of its
label sectors with the code ensemble, derive the Admissibility pushforward,
and generate an append-only stochastic trajectory. Preparation affinity plus
effect-complete label-retaining equivalence could then force the trace ratios
without a new axiom. An explicit unraveling or actuality semantics would still
be needed to name the observed path. Such a law
would turn the conditional construction here into an autonomous positive
theory and would defeat any claim that an actuality axiom is unavoidable.
That is a convincing attack on the broader measurement no-go, which is
therefore `FAIL / DO NOT SHIP`; it is not a counterexample to the narrowly
quantified deterministic affine theorem because the trajectory/unraveling is
stochastic and explicitly outside its domain.

The present result helps that steelman: the code, local geometry, guarded
support, residual state, and exact finite history are solved on the fixture.
The physical ensemble identity, microscopic formation, seed reachability,
actual member, and time map remain separate terminal obligations.

### N8 — Cross-cycle echo

| earlier wall | later mechanism | relevance now |
|---|---|---|
| Block 4 effect rail versus branch-state payload | Block 5 exposed their literal inequality | separate exact projections solve the type splice |
| Block 5 eager generic formation gate | stage-specific exact typed orbit guards | exact frontier census and 24-of-144 enumeration remove preemption and near-spoof formation |
| controlled-copy pointer versus occurrence | locked-output and Record firewall kept the types separate | do not rename a coherent/dephased pointer as one actual Record |
| August atomic carrier support | total kernels can place compiled codes in support | support is constructible but still does not select weights |
| menu-frame Born forcing | affinity/frame-function results can force trace form conditionally | now applicable downstream because a physical code compiler exists |
| repeated axiom-pressure episodes | downstream conventions often closed apparent foundation gaps | test preparation affinity and microscopic formation before proposing an axiom edit |

**Gate disposition:** `PASS` for the exact typed compiler, staged conditional
completion, trace-history match, conditional cq weight uniqueness, free-weight
control, and deterministic affine class theorem. Universal impossibility,
failure of stochastic or nonlinear
routes, axiom necessity, axiom adoption, and retained TOE closure are
`FAIL / DO NOT SHIP`.

## 11. TOE And Portfolio Decision

Block 6 materially advances the route even though the formal percentages stay
frozen. The two concrete Block-5 integration defects are no longer blockers:

- branch-state content and effect-rail role coexist without equality;
- the residual site is exactly delayed until `CB` exists;
- every nonzero exact branch operator is in the declared local support;
- the trace-matched finite Record history equals the supplied staged
  instrument history exactly.

What remains is not “make a pointer” or “search for weights.” It is to derive
the physical equality between the label-retaining cq instrument ensemble and
the Admissibility/Record ensemble. The sector lemma then fixes the weights.
Preparation affinity is useful only together with effect identification and
operational equivalence strong enough to exclude wrong affine laws. A
fresh-ancilla repeated-interaction/trajectory model is the co-equal
non-gravity attack on formation and actual-member semantics, not a deferred
fallback.

The operational discriminator is already exact. Auxiliary label projectors
give front mass `3/10` versus `2/3`, conditional A mass `19/35` versus `3/7`,
and conditional B mass `1/2` versus `4/9`. Full cq certification requires the
observables `P_j tensor {I,X,Y,Z}` on a retained label plus post-branch qubit,
a tomographically spanning preparation family, and direct-versus-physically-
randomized preparations whose randomizer Record is demonstrably screened.
Block 7 counts as a derivation only if it constructs a probability-independent
Record readout/intertwiner that reproduces that cq operational object—or
equivalently proves both `F_j=K_j^dagger K_j` and the conditional-map identity.
Affinity alone proves only `q_j(rho)=Tr(F_j rho)` for some POVM and therefore
does not identify `F_j` with the instrument effect.

Gravity remains externally owned. No foundation axiom, primitive registry,
audit verdict, or TOE score changes in this proposal.

Each executable ends with `TOTAL: PASS=n FAIL=n`. Runner success is proposal

The independent resolution certificate is:

per_block: checked — independently verified exact history weights, CP residual recovery, three disjoint cubic orbits, covariance, and all frontier formation sites
