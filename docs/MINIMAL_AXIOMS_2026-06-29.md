# Minimal Framework Axioms (Lattice, Qubit, Admissibility, Record)

**Date:** 2026-06-29
**Type:** meta
**Status:** current public framework axiom memo for the qubit-on-`Z^3`
package with local admissibility and fixed scalar record readout.
**Status authority:** explicit owner approval for the 2026-06-29 foundation
reset is recorded in `docs/audit/AXIOM_MINIMALITY_POLICY.md` section 6.
Audit status remains set only by the independent audit lane.

**Supersedes:** `MINIMAL_AXIOMS_2026-06-05.md`. The 2026-06-05 memo remains the
historical source for the prior Lattice/Quantum/Record wording in which
realized outcome was latent in Record and no explicit local admissibility
constraint was named.

## Purpose

This note states the framework's minimal ontology premises. They are named
rather than treated as bare letter codes:

1. **Lattice**
2. **Qubit**
3. **Admissibility**
4. **Record**

Legacy `A1`/`A2` numbering and the older `Quantum` axiom name are historical.
New repo surfaces should use the axiom names above unless quoting an older
document.

## The Four Framework Axioms

### Lattice / Physical Locality

Physical sites are the points of the cubic lattice `Z^3`, with nearest-neighbor
adjacency, standard translations, and proper cubic rotations about each site.

No site is privileged. Sites are distinguished by the supplied lattice
structure alone.

### Qubit / Site Possibility

Each site has a domain of local possibilities.

The full one-site possibility domain has algebraic presentation `M_2(C)`.

A `Cl(3,0)`-compatible real-algebra presentation may be used equivalently and
adds no further primitive structure.

No possibility is privileged. Possibilities are distinguished by the supplied
algebraic structure alone.

### Admissibility / Local Constraint

There is one fixed nearest-neighbor admissibility rule, covariant under lattice
translations and proper cubic rotations.

For each site, the available possibilities are determined by, and vary with,
the nearest-neighbor conditions.

### Record / Fixed Reality

A site need not carry a record.

When present, a record locks exactly one local possibility from the subset
available at that site under Admissibility; records are permanent and
invariant under repeated readout.

Only records are readable. A readout value is determined by record content
alone. For any finite collection of pairwise-disjoint records, scalar readout
`I` is additive, with `I(empty)=0`.

## Qualification

These axioms state only their named primitive content. Further physical
structure requires derivation, bridge, explicit admission, or approved
primitive registration before use as a premise.

A state is a configuration of records.

A law privileges no states. Its domain is a supplied condition, and at every
state where the condition holds it gives exactly one answer.

## Audit-Pipeline Treatment

The machine-readable source of this axiom set is the stable `minimal_axioms`
entry in `docs/audit/data/axiom_premise_nodes.json`. Dependencies on
`minimal_axioms` chain-satisfy without making downstream rows
`retained_bounded`.

**Primary runner:** `scripts/audit_companion_minimal_axioms_clean_base_exact.py`
checks only elementary algebra/notation sanity for the four axiom names. It
does not derive or enlarge the axiom set.

Axioms and approved primitives are not Tier-A admitted derivation targets.
Depending on the Lattice, Qubit, Admissibility, or Record axiom, or on an
explicitly approved primitive such as `scale_reference_primitive`, must not be
treated as a source of bounded status. Bounded status belongs to non-axiom
Tier-A admissions recorded in `docs/audit/data/tier_a_admissions.json`.

## Relation To Dynamics And Kinetic Branch Selection

Admissibility is not a dynamics axiom. It determines availability by a
nearest-neighbor rule: for each site, the available possibilities are
determined by, and vary with, the nearest-neighbor conditions. It does not
choose a Hamiltonian or transfer operator, supply transition probabilities or
weights, select a scalar or nonzero kinetic branch, assert a Dirac-square
carrier, define a time metric, or provide a record-production process.

Static spatial kinetic questions, probability/process questions, and temporal
evolution questions should be tracked separately. A realized kinetic branch, if
proposed, is downstream content: it needs derivation, bridge, explicit
admission, or approved primitive registry update before audit rows may use it
as load-bearing content. The four axioms are compatible with such later
content, but do not include it.

## Relation To The Older Observable-Principle Parent

`OBSERVABLE_PRINCIPLE_FROM_AXIOM_NOTE.md` is not this axiom note and is not an
approved axiom-premise node. It remains a broader conditional parent that
packages additive scalar observables with further readout/log-det/modulus
structure. That older parent must not be moved wholesale into
`docs/audit/data/axiom_premise_nodes.json`.

Rows that require only the Record axiom should cite this minimal-axiom
authority. Rows that require P2/modulus, log-det, source/action, measurement,
Born weights, readout-context selection, central-sector decomposition, `K`/CPT
structure, transition relations, record-production dynamics, physical
persistence dynamics, local observability, or any other additional bridge must
cite separate retained authorities or remain bounded/pending according to the
audit ledger.

## Relation To The 2026-06-05 Record Wording

The 2026-06-05 Record axiom named durable realized-outcome registration and
gave a `K`/CPT orbit reading once a finite central-sector readout context and
fixed `K`/CPT conjugation were supplied. This reset separates generic site
possibility, local admissibility, and fixed records from context-specific
readout structure:

- Qubit names the domain of local possibilities and its full one-site algebraic
  presentation.
- Admissibility names the nearest-neighbor rule by which, for each site, the
  available possibilities are determined by, and vary with, the
  nearest-neighbor conditions.
- Record names the fixed locking of one available local possibility, plus finite
  scalar readout additivity over disjoint record collections.
- `K`/CPT orbit structure, central-sector decomposition, and any sector
  generation rule are downstream readout-context content, not generic axiom
  content.

## Open Gates And Admissions Outside The Axioms

The four axioms do not close, import, or rename the framework's downstream open
gates. In particular, the following remain outside axiom content:

- the staggered-Dirac/finite-Grassmann realization and `AC_phi_lambda`;
- the strong-CP theta admission;
- P2/modulus/phase-blindness and any log-det readout theorem;
- context selection, measurement basis selection, Born weights, probability
  rules, update laws, decoherence mechanisms, and occurrence rules;
- arrow, record-production dynamics, physical persistence dynamics, time metric,
  and local observability of records;
- source/action and physical-observable identification;
- `g_bare = 1` convention handling;
- the scale-reference primitive and the separate gravity self-consistency
  question that the framework's natural unit equals the Planck length.

## Historical Context

The April 15 through May 20 sequence separated the one-qubit local algebra and
the `Z^3` lattice from downstream realization gates that had previously been
written too axiomatically. The 2026-06-04 memo added scalar finite Record
additivity as the third explicitly approved premise. The 2026-06-05 memo refined
Record to durable realized-outcome registration in a supplied readout context.

This memo exposes the remaining minimal ontology needed by the blocked audit
lanes: records are not arbitrary mosaics. The admissibility rule determines the
available possibilities at each site from the nearest-neighbor conditions, and
those available possibilities vary with those conditions, before a record can
lock one available local possibility. Probability, dynamics, readout contexts,
and physical observable bridges remain downstream.
