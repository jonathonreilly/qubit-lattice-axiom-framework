# Correlated residual certificates for the native Ward observable

**Type:** bounded_theorem.

Status: conditional-support, with two accepted bounded calculations. Full pipeline, current-main combined verification, changed-audit readiness and formal audit: UNRUN.

The signed-dual calculation narrows the two retained alpha intervals, but both still contain zero. The earlier zero-dual screen is retained as historical conditional evidence; its negative certification is deferred. Neither result establishes alpha's sign, nonvanishing, or law selection.

## Supplied identity and the signed residual correction

We retain the original infinite native model, reference vacuum and Ward boundary identity supplied by the preceding canonical hierarchy. Set h=1. On the direct sum of the15 two-neighbor channels, H=diag(D_A)>=delta=1/4, J_A=2i gamma(d_A), C=-J, C*=J. The common g=gamma(e0) is self-adjoint unitary; T is adjacency of disjoint two-subsets of six labels and commutes with g. Write B=Tg; this B is distinct from the local impurity B_A=i g gamma(d_A).

For the exact states x=-H^-1 Omega_vector and v=H^-1 J H^-1 Omega_vector, the supplied observable is W=8alpha=Re(<x,Tx>-<x,Bv>). The inner product is conjugate-linear in its first argument. Keep the same degree1 polynomial trials x0=-p(H)Omega and v0=qJp(H)Omega and certified direct-sum errors ||e||<=E, ||f||<=F. All scalar, domain and source-family premises remain those of the accepted trials.

For arbitrary polynomial dual vectors y,z define r=-Omega-Hx0=He, s=Cx0-Hv0=Hf-Ce and correction=Re(<r,y>+<s,z>). Direct expansion gives

W-W0-correction = Re<e,2Tx0-Bv0-Hy+C*z> + Re<f,-B*x0-Hz> + R(e,f),

where R=<e,Te>-Re<e,Bf>. Thus a signed correction shifts the center, while two residual norms bound the remaining linear error. No commutation of H with T or g, independence of residuals, or replacement of a vacuum inverse by an operator norm is assumed.

## Quadratic remainder bound and historical negative evidence

Let N be the6-by15 vertex-edge incidence matrix of K6. Since NN*=4I+J6 and T=J15+I-N*N, the eigenvalues of T are6,-3,1 with multiplicities1,5,9. Hence T²<=3T+18I. Put a=||e|| and m=<e,Te>/a². Minimizing a²m-aF sqrt(3m+18) over -3<=m<=6 and0<=a<=E yields

L(E,F) = -3E²-3EF for F<=2E;
L(E,F) = -6E²-3F²/4 for2E<=F<=4E;
L(E,F) = 6E²-6EF for F>=4E.

These branches agree at their boundaries and decrease as either nonnegative error bound increases. The constructive lower bound is the current claim. The original proof additionally supplies abstract extremizers in the 6 and -3 eigenspaces with appropriately aligned gf; certification of its norm-only optimality claim is deferred, and that optimality is not needed for validity of the lower bound.

Historical zero-dual evidence (negative certification deferred): with zero duals, the lower bound is W0-E||2Tx0-Bv0||-F||B*x0||+L. Since both norm penalties are nonnegative, W0_upper+L(E_upper,F_upper)<=0 rules out a strictly positive lower endpoint from this fixed zero-dual certificate. It does not rule out smaller certified errors, nonzero dual corrections or a nonzero physical alpha.

The completed screen returned this limited exclusion for both fixed modes, with zero pair kernels computed. The original spectral interval was retained. The accepted screen is not retroactively relabeled a sign result.

## Closed kernels and reduced action data

Write u_A=p0_A,w_A=p1_A,V_A=4w_A. The trials are x0_A=-(u_A+w_A B_A)Omega and v0_A=q_A(2iu_A gamma(d_A)+V_A g)Omega. For n=|C intersect A| and the same c=<B_A>, the real kernels are

X_CA=u_Cu_A+c(u_Cw_A+w_Cu_A)+n w_Cw_A,
Y_CA=q_Cq_A[4n u_Cu_A+V_CV_A+2c(u_CV_A+V_Cu_A)],
Z_CA=-q_A[2u_A(cu_C+n w_C)+V_A(u_C+cw_C)].

The ordered minus sign in Z is essential. T² weights are6 for equal pairs,1 for disjoint pairs and3 for distinct intersecting pairs. Summing gives G0,G1,G2, with ||B*x0||²=G0 and ||2Tx0-Bv0||²=4G0+G1-4G2. The lower endpoint of G2 is used in an upper bound on the latter norm.

Nonzero duals require additional signed data. For each channel set U=B*x0 and V=2Tx0-Bv0. Using [H0,gamma(f)]=i gamma(Kf), H0Omega=0, g²=1 and ||d_A||²=2 reduces the vectors V,HV,JU,HJU to scalar/quadratic Clifford words, while U is linear and HU at most cubic. The first residual is at most quadratic and the inner residual linear. These are identities on the polynomial vacuum vectors, not arbitrary-state commutator replacements.

The complete action formulas are preserved in the reviewed proof snapshot. Their finite bank lies in (a,d,k,e,Kd,Kk,Ke), omitting e,Ke for opposite pairs. With neighbor combinations f=sum f_j b_j,h=sum h_j b_j, n=sum f_j h_j and m=sum f_j h_(j xor1), the dots are <f,h>=n, <Kf,Kh>=6n+m, <a,Kf>=-sum f_j; the nonzero covariances are kappa(a,f)=-(c/2)sum f_j and kappa(Kf,h)=3cn+(nu/6-3c)m. Antisymmetry and parity supply the remaining entries. Thus these new contractions need only the already authenticated c and nu; E,F retains its separate full spectral provenance.

Acquire the real4-Gram of(V,HV,JU,HJU), real2-Gram of(U,HU), and c0=Re<r,V>,c1=Re<r,JU>,c2=Re<s,U>. These13+3 entries support y=s0(V-tJU),z=-tU. The residual coefficient vectors are(1,-s0,-t,s0t) and(-1,t); the signed correction is s0c0-s0t c1-t c2. Certified interval quadratic forms and outward roots give the two norms. Negative norm uppers or empty certificate intersections refuse rather than manufacture success.

## Fixed proposals and five scales

Midpoint Rayleigh ratios propose t and then s0, clamped to[0,4] and rounded down to2^-64. Nonpositive denominators or arithmetic refusal use the predefined zero fallback. The midpoint is never treated as a PSD or optimizer certificate: all bounds use the original interval entries at the chosen exact dyadics.

For lambda in(0,1/2,1,3/2,2), scale both dual vectors uniformly. The coefficients become(1,-lambda*s0,-lambda*t,lambda*s0*t),(-1,lambda*t), and correction lambda times the unscaled correction. Replacing both parameters by their scaled values would incorrectly introduce lambda². All scales reuse the same contractions. Intersect their valid alpha intervals with the prior accepted interval; this cannot widen that prior interval, but need not establish a sign. The zero-dual screen cannot suppress these signed candidates.

## Accepted outcome and its limits

The reduced signed-dual study completed once in4.65 seconds externally, with82,706,432-byte external RSS and119,488,512-byte sampled whole-tree peak. Its763 events and nine output files retain both modes,15 channels per mode and all five scales. Complete covariance/operator signatures allow exact reuse:684 expanded Wick words were evaluated versus5130 logical uncached words. These are distinct from recursive Wick-state counts.

For both modes lambda=1 supplies both final endpoints. Descriptive rounded intervals are:

| Mode | Prior spectral interval | Accepted signed-dual interval |
|---|---|---|
| Residual | [-734.76773,826.14955] | [-489.19594,665.70731] |
| Variational | [-737.70476,890.22488] | [-441.59020,696.19304] |

Lambda1/2 and the zero dual also improve on the prior interval, but less than lambda1. Lambda3/2 and2 do not improve either endpoint beyond lambda1. This describes the retained candidates; it is not a continuous optimization claim. Both final statuses remain INDETERMINATE_SIGN.

The worker's raw covariance and Wick correctness were independently source-reviewed. The root independently reconciled proposals, quadratic forms, signed corrections, scales and intersections, while explicitly inheriting raw Wick/scalar truth. The compact supporting checker authenticates this evidence boundary and tests synthetic algebra; it does not replay any native contractions.

Exact bytes, compressed event-stream recovery and original paths are in INVENTORY.json. Remote89 head8c202703bfd600147e7a27d146594859191ba610 supplies preregistration provenance; the completed outputs and all portable draft files are archived at remote90 commit6452b8ebd80680b6f211c6cc1eec2f1435ec05cf. Historical bytecode/membership preparation and retention/transient-bound repairs are preserved at remote89 commit8c202703bfd600147e7a27d146594859191ba610, in checkpoints/zero-dual-screen-reduced-dual-preregistration under the campaign packet. No audit or integration success is implied by this draft.

## Reproduction and provenance

Run `python3 scripts/native_correlated_ward_certificates_2026_09_10.py` for portable receipt and synthetic algebra checks. This does not replay the native Wick calculations. The packet (`outputs/native_correlated_ward_certificates_2026_09_10_inputs/HANDOFF.md`) preserves exact imported files and recovery maps. The [prior stronger estimates](NATIVE_STRONGER_WARD_ESTIMATORS_NOTE_2026-09-10.md) and [finite hierarchy](NATIVE_FINITE_MOMENT_WARD_NOTE_2026-09-10.md) supply the fixed trials, nominal and spectral error bounds. Source review, integration validation and independent formal audit are separate; the latter two are unrun here.


## Current compact evidence boundary

The [canonical cache](../logs/runner-cache/native_correlated_ward_certificates_2026_09_10.txt) records only the current compact receipt, identity and synthetic checks. The current capture budget is 30 seconds and 384 MiB with external process-tree supervision. Historical source, results and resource receipts retain their original identities and protocol limits; this compact run does not repeat their numerical calculations. The raw original packet and its input manifests are retained under `outputs/native_correlated_ward_certificates_2026_09_10_inputs/`. Historical review assertions are provenance, not a current review verdict.

## Current claim disposition

Current claims are the constructive identities, valid conditional enclosure bounds, moment-supplier constructions and explicitly finite certificate outcomes described above. Certification of the historical constant-trial/all-q exclusions, zero-dual exclusion and norm-only optimality claim is deferred: the exact-target No-Go Discipline route requirement is unmet. Their original proofs and results remain byte-exact in the input packets as historical conditional evidence. They are not current closed negative claims or premises needed to establish the constructive bounds.

## No-Go Discipline record and limitation

Historical argument (current negative certification deferred): The zero-dual obstruction applies only to the fixed zero-dual certificate and its original errors. The sharp remainder is an infimum under the stated abstract norm constraints, not a theorem that native error vectors realize every extremizer. Five signed-dual scales are five fixed candidates, not a continuous optimum.

**N1 — Actual mechanisms and unresolved quota.** The unit records the following five genuinely different historical mechanisms. They are not five failed in-domain attacks against any one negative theorem. The exact-target five-route requirement is not established by this inventory; no No-Go Discipline Gate PASS is asserted for those negative claims. The table preserves actual attempts without inventing additional tests.

| Mechanism | Actual retained outcome | Relation to the original all-q obstruction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Polynomial inverse approximation with gap-residual error | Degree10 and degree20 certificates remain indeterminate | Only the frozen degree10 first polynomials and original estimator are covered; degree20 lies outside |
| Posterior trial-norm enclosure | Degree10 and degree20 certificates remain indeterminate | A different error functional, outside that obstruction |
| Quadratic spectral-residual envelope | Two fixed degree10 choices remain indeterminate | A different estimator using residual moments |
| Correlated signed-dual correction | Five fixed scales narrow the enclosure but remain indeterminate | A different center and error estimator |
| Quartic spectral envelope with higher Gaussian moments | Two same-degree20 modes remain indeterminate | A new moment mechanism and first polynomials outside the original target |

Changing polynomial degree alone, changing lambda, or supplying the moments does not create an additional mechanism family. No row rules out the full physical alpha problem.

**N2 — Dependencies, not independent obstructions.** The supplied model, reference and CAR/normal-order conventions define the objects; the Ward identity defines the observable; the channel gap controls inverse bounds. Certified numerical moments are downstream conditional data, not independent physical constraints. The determinant germ uses bounded h0, finite-rank perturbation and absence of a zero atom; it does not itself require the impurity gap. The inverse and quartic estimates separately require that gap. No count of independent impossibility arguments is inferred from these dependencies.

**N3 — Exact hypotheses.** The all-q bound retains the frozen first polynomial and original residual error functional, with honest residual bounds for the second trial. The constant-trial statement retains the specified constant choices and scalar inputs. The zero-dual screen retains its original errors. Norm-only sharpness allows abstract error vectors obeying the stated norm bounds and operator premises; extra native correlations can improve the estimate. All numerical conclusions inherit the supplied model and the certified input intervals.

**N4 — Residual-to-claim record.** The paths below identify retained historical negative evidence and finite descriptive outcomes, not current negative certification or new executions.

| Retained record | Exact residual or conclusion | What it does not establish |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Finite-moment `imports/ALL_Q.md` and `ALLQ_RESULT.json` | Neither strict-sign test succeeds for the frozen p and original error estimator | Failure of another p or estimator |
| Finite-moment `imports/DEGREE10.md`, constant section | The specified original constant p/q sign test is inconclusive | Failure of every constant trial or error bound |
| Correlated `source_draft/proofs/sharp.md`, section 2 | Sharp abstract norm-only remainder, with extremizers in the 6 and -3 eigenspaces | Realization by the actual native errors |
| Correlated `source_draft/evidence/zero/RESULT.json` and sharp proof section 1 | The fixed zero-dual lower-endpoint screen does not become strictly positive | Failure of signed-dual corrections |
| Signed-dual and quartic saved results | Particular certified enclosures contain zero | A general physical no-go or alpha equal to zero |

**N5 — Resolution and execution scope.** Per element: exact rational, sign and identity checks apply to the retained finite inputs. Per site: no new sitewise native calculation is executed. Per mode: only the stated saved modes and candidates are compared. Per block: compact receipt checks and synthetic controls cover the declared packet. Lattice wide: infinite-model conclusions rely on their stated analytical proofs and premises; compact checks do not replay the numerical catalog, native moments or an infinite lattice.

**N6 — Missing implication.** Indeterminate certificates leave a sign decision open; they do not require a new axiom. A better first polynomial, a sharper certified residual estimate or additional justified correlations can change the certificate. Those routes require their own compatible nominal, residual and input proofs.

**N7 — Concrete steelman.** A signed-dual route takes y=s(V-tJU) and z=-tU, retains the signed corrections <r,y>+<s,z>, and computes both residual norms from complete Gram data. A successful attack would certify the corrected positive endpoint. The retained lambda=1 attempt narrows the interval but does not prove that endpoint positive. A richer first polynomial with certified higher moments is another concrete route. These escapes change the old obstruction's domain; they preserve its narrow algebra while preventing a universal inference. Scaling lambda scales both trial vectors linearly, not quadratically.

**N8 — Prior-work echo.** The constant-trial limitation led to degree-one/two trials; the original all-q error obstruction led to posterior and spectral estimators; the zero-dual limitation led to signed corrections. These are recorded changes of scope, not proofs of a physical sign and not demands for new axioms. The unresolved exact-target N1 quota remains a packet limitation, separately from validity of the conditional algebra and positive enclosure constructions.

## Recovered scientific input closure

The [scientific recovery manifest](work_history/repo/review_feedback/pr8079-8083-scientific-recovery/manifest.json) binds the relevant catalog geometry and endpoint records, producer and arithmetic-root sources, and saved rho5/omega5/omega79 arithmetic payloads. Existing exact catalog objects are reused from landed archives. Original compact packets retain the degree20 event stream and later trial/Gram/moment records. The manifest is a declared proof-identity input; the compact runner does not read or recompute every recovered numerical payload. Historical execution receipts keep their original dates, source identities and resource scopes.
