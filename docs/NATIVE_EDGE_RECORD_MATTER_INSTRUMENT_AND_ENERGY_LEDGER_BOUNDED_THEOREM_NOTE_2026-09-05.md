# Native physical edge Records, fermion parity, and a common energy ledger

**Date:** 2026-09-05

**Type:** bounded_theorem

**Status:** conditional-support; working draft pending executable review

**Audit:** unset; the independent audit lane owns any verdict.

## Target and supplied physical meaning

This result connects an existing physical edge-qubit Record model to its
fermion dynamics through repeated events. A local edge Record has two exact
fermion meanings. While its edge lies on a remaining cycle it leaves the
surviving CAR state unchanged. When its edge disconnects a component it
projects that component's fermion parity. Both operations preserve the
original total particle number and admit the energy account proved below.

The construction needs no separate occupation-to-physical-Record compiler
for this native edge instrument. It changes the instrument used in an
occupation-site-deletion model: vertices remain, edges cease to hop, and
component parities can be measured. It does not realize that different
site-deletion process. BKSF encoding and one-bond deletion are established
ingredients, not the contribution claimed here.

Let a finite nearest-neighbor graph have virtual vertices at $2v$ and the
qubit for $(v,v+e_a)$ at physical lattice site $2v+e_a$. Distinct edges have
distinct centers; these are actual $M_2(\mathbb C)$ site factors in ordinary
tensor composition. Every other site is a spectator. This explicit
placement supplies a periodic choice of roles, a coarse cell, and a Pauli
basis. It does not derive a preferred origin, covariant role selection, or
the framework's nearest-neighbor admissibility distribution. A bounded
support Hamiltonian is not, by itself, that admissibility law.

The ideal event's projector is on one physical site and needs no extra clean
local pointer factor. Its occurrence, Born probabilities, and Lueders state
update are supplied. The energy apparatus is an additional construction:
it preserves the final Record values but generally changes conditional
matter coherences. Its control, energy carrier, preparation, and spatial
implementation remain supplied. A coherent history dilation may use
degenerate storage; no bound on all controller memory is claimed.

kinetic isotropy, and realized state were read. Those approved primitives
are not classified as missing premises. None supplies the carrier, chosen
sea, event distribution, or apparatus used here. No new primitive, axiom
change, empirical value, fitted coefficient, or audit status is introduced.

## Definitions and algebra

Let $G=(V,E)$ be finite, connected, loopless and simple, with $M\ge2$
vertices and $L\ge1$ edges. Give vertices labels and each neighbor set a
fixed order. Orient $A_{ij}$ by $\epsilon_{ij}=1$ for $i<j$ and
$\epsilon_{ji}=-\epsilon_{ij}$. On the edge-qubit Hilbert space define

\[
B_i=\prod_{e\ni i}Z_e,\qquad
A_{ij}=\epsilon_{ij}X_{ij}
 \prod_{k<_i j}Z_{ik}\prod_{l<_j i}Z_{jl},\qquad
T_{ij}=\frac i2 A_{ij}(B_i-B_j).
\tag{1}
\]

Here the two ordered products omit edge $ij$. Set
$h_e=a_e T_e$, with real $|a_e|\le t$, $t>0$; set
$H_R=\sum_{e\notin R}h_e$ and $N=\sum_v(1-B_v)/2$.
All Hamiltonians use one common empty-fermion-vacuum zero; no
history-dependent scalar subtraction is permitted.

The operators $A,B$ are Hermitian involutions, $A_{ji}=-A_{ij}$,
$A_{ij}$ anticommutes with $B_i,B_j$ and commutes with other $B$'s.
Two distinct $A$'s anticommute exactly when their edges share one vertex.
These statements follow by counting the ordered $X,Z$ crossings. For a
simple oriented cycle $C=(v_0,\ldots,v_\ell=v_0)$ set

\[
S_C=i^\ell A_{v_0v_1}\cdots A_{v_{\ell-1}v_0}.
\tag{2}
\]

It is a Hermitian involution commuting with every $A,B$. Its Pauli
$X$ support is precisely the cycle. The phase is $i^\ell$, including
$i^6=-1$; a square-only phase convention is insufficient.

The initial code has every $S_C=+1$. After a history with recorded edges
$R$ and signs $z_r$, impose those old $Z_r=z_r$ and only cycles of
$G_R=(V,E\setminus R)$. Denote this code projector by $P_R$.
Let $q=L-|R|$ and let $c$ count all connected components, including
isolated vertices. All subsequent statements about a conditional state
refer to a nonzero branch; an impossible fixed-number branch is omitted.

## Theorem 1: remaining code and faithful fermion dictionary

The code dimension is $2^{M-c}$. Its component parities are

\[
\pi_C=\prod_{r\in\partial_G C}z_r,\qquad
\prod_C\pi_C=1.
\tag{3}
\]

Its surviving $A,B$ algebra is the product of the full matrix algebras on
the fixed-parity fermion sectors of the components. It is faithfully
identified with

\[
B_v=1-2c_v^\dagger c_v,\qquad
A_{ij}=-i\gamma_{2i}\gamma_{2j},\qquad
T_{ij}=c_i^\dagger c_j+c_j^\dagger c_i,
\tag{4}
\]

where $\gamma_{2i}=c_i+c_i^\dagger$ and
$\gamma_{2i+1}=-i(c_i-c_i^\dagger)$.
This concerns even CAR within each component. Odd global parity is not
represented by the unaugmented carrier because $\prod_vB_v=I$.

**Proof.** Choose a spanning forest of $G_R$. Each nontree edge gives a
fundamental cycle whose $X$ support contains that nontree edge alone among
the selected nontree coordinates. Thus the $q-M+c$ cycle checks are
independent. Old $Z$ checks add $|R|$ independent constraints: no nonempty
product of cycle checks has vanishing $X$ support, and no nonempty product
of old $Z$ checks is scalar. The commuting check group contains no $-I$.
Cycle relations from multiplication along paths generate every remaining
cycle from these fundamental cycles. Explicitly, the path operator
$U_P=i^{|P|}\prod_PA$ concatenates along consecutive paths and obeys
$U_{\bar P}U_P=I$: each immediate reverse-edge pair contributes
$i^2A_{ij}A_{ji}=I$. Insert forest paths from a component root before
and after each edge in a closed path. Successive reverse forest paths
cancel, leaving the product of its fundamental loops; these loops are
central by the displayed commutation relations. Thus no additional
independent cycle constraint has been omitted. The dimension follows from
$2^{L-(|R|+q-M+c)}$.

Multiplying $B_v$ over a component cancels internal edge $Z$ factors and
gives (3). A computational-basis assignment on live edges gives vertex
occupations by its binary incidence boundary plus the old boundary signs.
The incidence map has rank $M-c$; its image is exactly the patterns with
the component parities (3). Each such pattern has a fiber of size
$2^{q-M+c}$. The cycle checks act freely and transitively on that fiber
through their $X$ supports. The consistent $+1$ eigenspace on the fiber
therefore has dimension one.

Products of spanning-forest $A$'s connect any two occupation patterns with
the same component parities. Combining them with the one-dimensional
occupation projectors produces every matrix unit on this space. To check
that this full matrix algebra has the identification (4), use the displayed
anticommutation relations and cycle identities to reduce any word to a
product of a subset of forest $A$'s and a subset of $M-c$ independent
$B$'s. There are at most $2^{2(M-c)}$ such words. Both the physical
representation just constructed and the direct CAR representation (4)
satisfy these relations and generate a full matrix algebra of precisely
that dimension. They are faithful representations of the same quotient
algebra and are unitarily intertwined. In particular the hopping formula
in (4) follows by substituting the two Majoranas, without a fitted phase.

At fixed total $N$, the dimension is

\[
\sum_{\substack{\sum_C N_C=N\\(-1)^{N_C}=\pi_C}}
 \prod_C\binom{|C|}{N_C}.
\tag{5}
\]

This can vanish. For an initial half-filled code sea we require $M$ a
multiple of four, so $N=M/2$ belongs to global even parity.

## Theorem 2: the native Record instrument

Choose a live edge $e$ and measure the single-site projectors
$Q_{e,z}=(I+zZ_e)/2$, $z=\pm1$. Delete exactly its hopping term:
$H'=H_R-h_e$. This stipulated ideal event has the following two cases.

**Nonbridge.** Both outcomes have probability $1/2$ for every state
supported on the current code. The map $J_z=\sqrt2Q_{e,z}P_R$ is an
isometry onto the new code and preserves the state functional on the
entire surviving CAR algebra.

**Bridge.** Let $C$ be one side of the split in its former component and
$s_C=\prod_{r\in\partial_G C\cap R}z_r$. The measurement is precisely
the component-parity instrument

\[
Q_{e,z}\big|_{P_R}
=\frac12\left(I+z s_C\prod_{v\in C}B_v\right)\bigg|_{P_R}.
\tag{6}
\]

Its probabilities depend on the state and may be zero or one. Each branch
code has half the previous dimension before any fixed-$N$ restriction.
The newly fixed component parity is readable as the product of its
boundary Record values: every edge in that boundary is now recorded.
For an isolated vertex this product is $B_v$, so its occupation
$(1-B_v)/2$ is a function of Record content alone. This does not make
occupation at a vertex with unrecorded incident edges directly readable.

**Proof.** If $e$ is a nonbridge, a remaining cycle contains it. Its
stabilizer $S$ anticommutes with $Z_e$ and has $SP_R=P_R$. Consequently
$P_RZ_eP_R=0$ and $P_RQ_{e,z}P_R=P_R/2$. Surviving generators commute
with both $S$ and $Z_e$, so for every observable $O$ in their algebra,
$\operatorname{Tr}(\rho Z_eO)=0$ and

\[
\frac{\operatorname{Tr}(Q_{e,z}\rho Q_{e,z}O)}{1/2}
=\operatorname{Tr}(\rho O).
\tag{7}
\]

Deleting a nonbridge reduces $q$ and the cycle rank by one with $c$
unchanged. The new code has the old dimension, so the isometric inclusion
is onto. This identifies states through the faithful surviving algebra;
the physical branch vectors themselves are orthogonal, not equal.

For a bridge, every edge in the original cut $\partial_G C$ except $e$
is already recorded. Cancelling internal edges in $\prod_{v\in C}B_v$
gives (6), including all old signs. Here $q$ decreases and $c$ increases,
so the code dimension halves. No Gaussian closure is used. Destroyed cycle
checks must not be kept after a nonbridge event.

## Theorem 3: physical support, number, and repeated energy moments

Each $h_e$ has $X/Y$ support only on $e$, so $Q_{e,z}h_eQ_{e,z}=0$.
Every surviving $h_f$ commutes $Z_e$. Direct algebra in (1) gives

\[
[N,h_e]=[N,Z_e]=0,\qquad
h_e^2=\frac{a_e^2}{2}(I-B_iB_j),\qquad \|h_e\|\le |a_e|\le t.
\tag{8}
\]

For the first commutator, $h_e$ commutes all $B$'s except possibly those
at its endpoints; its commutator with $B_i+B_j$ vanishes because
$(B_i-B_j)(B_i+B_j)=0$. Individual Pauli summands need not conserve $N$.
All old Record values and an initially sharp total $N$ therefore persist
under every event and every current-Hamiltonian dwell.

In the midpoint placement, each factor in $h_e$ lies in the two endpoint
stars. Every edge center in these stars has Manhattan distance at most
two from the center of $e$. Thus radius two and diameter four bound the
physical support uniformly, with at most eleven site factors at degree
six. Deleting terms introduces no larger supports. This is a bound for
the stipulated matter Hamiltonian, not the full apparatus gate.

Let the next edge be uniform among the $q$ live edges, chosen after a
common dwell that may depend on the past history but not on that next
choice. Conditional on that history, selection is independent of the
current matter and battery, including their correlations. Outcome
averaging leaves powers of $H_R-h_e$ unchanged, giving

\[
\frac1q\sum_e(H_R-h_e)=(1-1/q)H_R,
\quad
\frac1q\sum_e(H_R-h_e)^2
=(1-2/q)H_R^2+\frac1q\sum_eh_e^2.
\tag{9}
\]

Let $\mu_k$ and $V_k$ be the mean and variance of energy including both
the classical history and quantum spectral distribution after $k$ events.
Since $q=L-k$ is the same at all histories, (9) yields, for $q\ge2$,

\[
\mu_{k+1}=(1-1/q)\mu_k,\quad
V_{k+1}=(1-2/q)V_k-\mu_k^2/q^2
 +\mathbb E_{R,e}\langle h_e^2\rangle\le V_k+t^2.
\tag{10}
\]

When $q=1$, the output Hamiltonian is zero; handle this endpoint directly.
Dwell preserves each incoming energy distribution. Therefore

\[
\boxed{\mu_K=\mu_0(1-K/L),\quad V_K\le V_0+Kt^2,\quad N_K=N_0.}
\tag{11}
\]

Fixed orders and nonuniform edge weights do not generally give the first
two formulas. The last formula is sharp number conservation for every
history, not merely an ensemble mean. All $M$ vertices remain in the
matter dictionary, including isolated ones. Total number thus includes
particles on inactive isolated vertices. Its conservation alone does not
bound how much matter remains on connected, propagating components.
Energy spectral distributions here are model diagnostics; no physical
energy-readout compiler is derived merely by calculating them.

For a supplied bipartite graph of maximum degree at most $d$ with all $|a_e|=t$,
let $h$ be the one-particle hopping matrix and initialize a sharp
half-filled ground sea in the allowed even sector. Its paired spectrum,
$\|h\|\le dt$, and $\operatorname{tr}h^2=2Lt^2$ imply
$E_0=-\operatorname{tr}|h|/2\le-Lt/d$; here
$|\lambda|\ge\lambda^2/(dt)$ for every eigenvalue, and zero modes
may be filled to reach half number. With $V_0=0$ and $K<L$, Chebyshev gives

\[
\mathbb P(H_K\ge0)
\le\min\left(1,\frac{d^2K}{(L-K)^2}\right).
\tag{12}
\]

This has a physical finite-volume realization without a periodic quotient.
For open cubic boxes of even side $\ell\ge2$, $M=\ell^3$,
$L=3\ell^2(\ell-1)$ and $d=6$ are valid. Thus
$E_0/M\le-(t/2)(1-1/\ell)$. At fixed recorded-edge fraction below one,
number density is exactly $1/2$, the mean energy density stays bounded
away from zero on its negative side, and $V_K/M^2$ tends to zero.
For an abstract degree-six regular graph, $L=3M$ recovers the equivalent
bound $4K/[M^2(1-K/L)^2]$; such a finite graph is not asserted to be
an open nearest-neighbor subgraph of $\mathbb Z^3$.
This does not prove transport, uniform component
density, a stationary state, or renewal of available edge sites.

## Theorem 4: shared energy apparatus and exact comparison

Include a prescribed finite schedule and degenerate control/history
storage in ideal isometries $W_k$. Histories are orthogonal output blocks;
old physical Record values are preserved. The history-block Hamiltonians
$H_k$ have $\|H_k\|\le B=tL$. For each selected edge the ideal
intertwining defect is $H_{\rm out}W-WH_{\rm in}=-Wh_e$, of norm at
most $t$.

On a comparison battery $L^2(\mathbb R,dE)$, let $T_u|E\rangle=|E+u\rangle$
and let battery energy be multiplication by $E$. For finite system
Hamiltonians define, with distinct eigenvalues grouped,

\[
\widetilde W=\sum_{a,b}\Pi_{\rm out}(b)W\Pi_{\rm in}(a)\otimes T_{a-b}.
\tag{13}
\]

In Fourier convention $T_u\mapsto e^{i\tau u}$ the fiber is
$W_\tau=e^{-i\tau H_{\rm out}}We^{i\tau H_{\rm in}}$ and hence an
isometry. Each summand proves exact total-energy intertwining. Using
the same battery for every step cancels adjacent Fourier factors, so
$\widetilde W_K\cdots\widetilde W_1=\widetilde{W_K\cdots W_1}$.
This is an operator identity and retains intermediate matter-battery
correlations.
Each incoming Hamiltonian preserves its remaining-cycle and old-Record
code, the ideal $W$ maps to the updated code, and each outgoing
Hamiltonian preserves that code. Hence every fiber, and the lifted
instrument, has the claimed updated code and sharp old Record outputs.

Prepare a normalized battery packet supported in $[2B,2B+w]$, cap its
physical energy domain to $[0,4B+w]$, and retain it. Initial total energy
is supported in $[B,3B+w]$. Since every intermediate system energy lies
in $[-B,B]$, its battery support lies in $[0,4B+w]$ at every prefix.
Thus capping removes no reachable amplitude. A completely defined
energy-intertwining gate on other inputs is obtained from the capped
contraction $S$ by adjoining the refusal component
$F=(I-S^\dagger S)^{1/2}$ in an orthogonal copy of the input sector.
$S^\dagger S$ commutes with input total energy, so does $F$; refusal
retains the input Hamiltonian. On all the reachable inputs just specified
$F=0$. This is a physical isometry with energy conservation; arbitrary
unitary/controller realization is a separate implementation problem.

For example, the normalized sine packet on this interval with $w=t$
has mean $2tL+t/2$ and cap $4tL+t$. The energy budget is extensive in
$L$, independent of the number of events $K\le L$. This bounded energy
interval is still an infinite-dimensional continuous carrier. No optimality
or finite-dimensional implementation for arbitrary incommensurate
Hamiltonians is asserted.

The pointwise pullbacks of the lifted energy moments are

\[
\frac1q\sum_e W_{e,\tau}^\dagger H'_e W_{e,\tau}=(1-1/q)H_R,
\quad
\frac1q\sum_e W_{e,\tau}^\dagger (H'_e)^2 W_{e,\tau}
=(1-2/q)H_R^2+
 e^{-i\tau H_R}\left(\frac1q\sum_eh_e^2\right)e^{i\tau H_R}.
\tag{14}
\]

The correction is bounded above by $t^2I$ at every $\tau$. These are
operator statements on arbitrary current correlated system-battery inputs,
so the exact mean, sharp number conservation, and variance bound in (11)
also hold for the implemented safe-cap process. Its second-moment
correction need not equal the ideal process's correction on a particular
state. Resetting to another safe battery would not invalidate the
pointwise bound; the retained battery supplies the single-resource budget
and whole-history composition used here. Exact total-energy accounting
means $\Delta\langle H_{\rm matter}\rangle+
\Delta\langle H_{\rm battery}\rangle=0$, with switch energy included in
the output Hamiltonian and the common zero convention.

If the full initial nonbattery state $\rho$ commutes with $H_0$ and is
prepared independently of the safe-cap battery, put
$\sigma_{\rm ideal}=W_{1:K}\rho W_{1:K}^\dagger$. Partial tracing the
shared lift gives

\[
\sigma_{\rm actual}=\int |\widehat\beta(\tau)|^2
 e^{-i\tau H_K}\sigma_{\rm ideal}e^{i\tau H_K}\,d\tau.
\tag{15}
\]

Every observable commuting with $H_K$ consequently has the same
expectation in the ideal and actual models. In particular their complete
procedural-history probabilities and conditional energy distributions
agree exactly, at every prefix. Uniform scheduling is needed for (11),
not this stationary-input comparison. Stationarity of only a reduced
matter marginal is insufficient if other nonbattery degrees of freedom
are correlated with it. A reference can be included when the joint input
commutes with $H_0\otimes I$.

Equation (15) does not imply equality of general conditional matter
coherences. The lifted gate need not be a single-site Lueders gate even
though its output has the specified sharp physical edge Record.
Procedural-history labels may include externally specified choice order;
the theorem does not make that order readable from final framework
Record content.
