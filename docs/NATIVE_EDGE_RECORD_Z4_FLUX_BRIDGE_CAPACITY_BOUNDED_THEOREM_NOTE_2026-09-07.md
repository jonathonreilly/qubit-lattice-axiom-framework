# Native Z4 flux Records: one-event boundary and controlled five-event construction

**Type:** bounded_theorem

The carry-sensitive high flux bit cannot be read by one Gaussian-preprocessed native bridge on the specified nine-mode code. A larger twelve-mode code and a supplied sixteen-history controller do admit five actual native bridge events whose physical output sites store both flux bits. These are different, explicitly declared instrument domains, so the construction does not contradict the boundary.

The [native instrument and energy-ledger parent](NATIVE_EDGE_RECORD_MATTER_INSTRUMENT_AND_ENERGY_LEDGER_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-09-05.md) supplies the physical edge projector and its bridge/nonbridge interpretation. Native code preparation, ready-input occurrence, control and scheduling remain premises. The result does not derive Wilson weights, a role-label phase compiler, or arbitrary universal gates.

Exact support: [single-bridge checker](../scripts/native_edge_record_z4_flux_single_bridge_check_2026_09_07.py) enumerates256 inputs,36 two-particle states and8 diagonal-sign controls. [Five-event checker](../scripts/native_edge_record_z4_flux_five_event_check_2026_09_07.py) enumerates256 inputs and8 actual physical three-site Pauli actions. These are finite support counts, not counts of all possible Gaussian controls or physical energy tests. The exterior-square argument below supplies the all-unitary quantifier.

## Single-event boundary on the nine-mode encoding

This is a bounded encoding-specific result, not a general compiler no-go. The generic Toffoli/modular-addition route was abandoned before implementation because it would import the gate family being sought. The construction and obstruction below use the actual native CAR/Record instrument.

## Existing native capabilities and the readout contract

`docs/NATIVE_EDGE_RECORD_MATTER_INSTRUMENT_AND_ENERGY_LEDGER_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-09-05.md`, definitions(1) and the Nonbridge/Bridge theorem around214–258, gives a physical edge-qubit projector Q_e,z=(I+zZ_e)/2. On a legal nonbridge code P_R Q_e,z P_R=P_R/2. On a bridge it is a signed component occupation-parity projection. Real hopping dwells are number-conserving quadratic CAR evolution; ordinary composition, code preparation, Born/Lueders occurrence and schedule remain supplied conditions.

Therefore an input-independent schedule of legal nonbridge events, with arbitrary intervening code-preserving unitary dwells, has a fair conditional sign at every event. A sign string from such a prefix cannot carry a nonconstant flux value. This does NOT say the post-event matter, apparatus, selected edge or joint correlations are input-independent. Reading them changes the readout contract. The energy-lift statement below is restricted to native signs and an initially independent ready battery.

The old frozen eight-vertex four-fermion cube has only70 matter states; its full fixed-parity CAR code has128. It cannot isometrically encode256 independent four-Z4 boundary labels while all other ready factors are fixed. That is only a dimensional check for that carrier. Extra sites, a different code, or encoding only gauge-equivalence classes are legitimate different tasks. No global capacity bound is claimed.

## Orthogonal native carrier extension and exact low-bit Record

Use a nine-vertex path with eight physical edge qubits. Its cycle-free BKSF even-parity code has dimension2^8=256. Let fermion modes0..3 store a0,b0,c0,d0; modes4..7 store a1,b1,c1,d1; mode8 stores r=(sum first8 bits) mod2. Every boundary label tuple(a,b,c,d) corresponds to a different even occupation basis vector, so this is an actual orthogonal code, not the corrected source's set injection diag(k/A_N,1). Preparing that code state and assigning these port roles are still explicit inputs.

Take Phi=a+b-c-d mod4. Its low bit is a0 xor b0 xor c0 xor d0. Cut the path bridge between modes3 and4. The native bridge-Z observable is exactly the occupation parity of component{0,1,2,3}, with the known old-record sign fixed. Its native Record outcome therefore reads the low flux bit deterministically on every encoded input, and its parity projection is nondemolition on those occupation basis inputs. This is a physical single-edge Record readout after the supplied code preparation. It need not read or alter every individual label Record first. The original labels are encoded in unrecorded native code degrees of freedom; it is not a protocol for moving already permanent site Records.

## Why a single Gaussian-preprocessed bridge cannot read the high bit

Permit any number-conserving quadratic CAR unitary before ONE native bridge readout, a larger class than the actual real nearest-neighbor path controls. The measured component parity has second-quantized one-particle form Gamma(D), D=I-2P_component. After such a dwell it is Gamma(R), R=V* D V, a Hermitian unitary reflection on the nine-dimensional one-particle space. Allow an overall known sign eta from old Records and outcome naming.

Suppose this one-shot measurement deterministically outputs the high bit of Phi on every one of the256 orthogonal even-parity inputs. Determinism for a Hermitian involution implies each such basis state is an eigenvector with the required sign. The vacuum has high bit0, so eta=+1, since Gamma(R) fixes the vacuum. In particular the entire two-particle sector is diagonal under Lambda²R: every one of its36 coordinate basis vectors is one of the encoded inputs.

If Lambda²R is diagonal in the coordinate wedge basis and R is invertible, R preserves every coordinate two-plane. Indeed a nonzero decomposable wedge determines its spanning two-plane. Intersect the planes span(e_i,e_j) over j!=i to conclude that R preserves each coordinate line. Thus R itself is diagonal. Because R is a Hermitian unitary, its diagonal entries r_i are±1. The eigenvalues on pairs must therefore be r_i r_j, and the product around any three-index triangle is+1.

The actual high-flux-bit table violates this. For occupied pairs(0,1),(0,2),(1,2), with all high modes and reference empty, the labels are respectively(a,b,c,d)=(1,1,0,0),(1,0,1,0),(0,1,1,0). Their fluxes are2,0,0, so high-bit signs are(-1,+1,+1), with product-1. Contradiction.

This proves a narrowly stated impossibility: on this explicit orthogonal native encoding, no single native bridge Record preceded by arbitrary number-conserving quadratic CAR evolution can deterministically read the high flux bit for every input. It is not an assumption that all parity processes are affine; it follows from the exterior-square matrix action and Hermitian reflection constraint. The complete finite truth table in result.json checks256 labels, all36 two-particle states, the low-bit identity and this exact three-sign witness.

## Energy-lift qualification

For the full-line energy lift of an ideal native branch, Fourier battery coordinate tau gives the branch column e^-iAout tau K_z e^iAin tau. Its squared effect is e^-iAin tau K_z* K_z e^iAin tau (orientation of tau is immaterial to the conclusion). On a nonbridge K_z*K_z=I/2, so native sign fairness is preserved exactly, including a retained correlated battery. This does not make other battery/matter observables uninformative.

For a bridge and an initially product ready battery, native sign probabilities are the positive tau-density average of the corresponding ideal parity effects conjugated by the incoming quadratic Hamiltonian. Any deterministic0/1 outcome on a given input forces the ideal effects to have that same value for almost every tau. Since there are only256 tested inputs, their full-measure sets can be intersected. At such a tau the one-shot Gaussian-parity contradiction above applies. Therefore an independent ready battery used only in this standard full-line lift does not evade this deterministic sign-readout obstruction. Scalar fuel energies cancel in the effect. A cap-safe restriction reproducing the full-line instrument on these inputs inherits the statement.

This paragraph does NOT cover input-correlated apparatus preloaded with information, reading battery energy as the answer, cap-refusal-dependent readout, approximation guarantees or arbitrary additional apparatus control. The native theorem itself retains supplied apparatus/control and possible nonlocal spectral-lift implementation. No new local energy-conserving gate family is derived.


## Positive five-event construction on an extended twelve-mode encoding

## Frozen scope and carrier

This follows the separately frozen positive-escape preregistration and original exact checker, executed before its explanatory proof. It is a positive escape from the earlier one-event and direct-two-event obstructions, on a larger prepared carrier with a supplied finite controller. It is not an axiomatic gate compiler, a minimal flux Lüders instrument, or a finite-battery realization.

The CAR path has twelve vertices in the fixed order
(a0,b0,c0,d0,a1,b1,c1,d1,q,qbar,r,anchor).
There are eleven native BKSF physical edge qubits e0,...,e10. Use the even fermion-parity code, dimension 2048. This tree has no cycle stabilizers. In its occupation dictionary the physical bit xj is the prefix parity n0 xor ... xor nj; consequently B0=Z0, Bj=Z(j-1)Zj internally, and B11=Z10. The 256 inputs have arbitrary eight data occupations, q=0, qbar=1, r=parity(data), anchor=1. Thus every input has even total parity, and the physical computational codewords are orthogonal. Preparing the correlated reference r is an input preparation assumption, not supplied by an arbitrary set injection.

Define the four oriented Z4 labels ai=a0+2a1, etc., and flux F=(a+b-c-d) mod4. The boundary labels are prepared occupation data, not already permanent Record signs. All eleven edges start live; their native coefficients and controlled pulse sign are taken in the displayed positive path convention.

## Actual event and pulse instrument

Record e0,e1,e2,e3 in that order with no intervening matter dwell. Their outcomes are the actual physical bits x0,x1,x2,x3 (Z sign (-1)^x). Every selected edge is a bridge. After each deletion its left endpoint has become isolated; after four deletions the low four vertices are isolated and modes4,...,11 still form a path. The native ready-input projectors are Qj,x=(I+(-1)^x Zj)/2. No generic Boolean quantum gate is used.

Let z=(x0,x1,x2,x3). A supplied classical controller with sixteen possible history states reconstructs li=xi xor x(i-1), with x(-1)=0, and computes
  L=(l0+l1-l2-l3) mod4,
  c=x3 xor floor(L/2).
The event schedule/pulse clock is additional supplied control; sixteen counts the stored history, not a complete autonomous controller implementation.

If c=1 apply U=exp[-i(pi/2)T8]; if c=0 apply identity. Then Record e8. Here T8 is the actual native whole hopping term joining adjacent CAR vertices q and qbar. With the path edge ordering,
  A8=X8 Z7, B8=Z7 Z8, B9=Z8 Z9,
  T8=(i/2) A8(B8-B9)=Y8(I-Z7Z9)/2.
This identity was checked on all eight physical three-bit basis states, including its complex phase. On the prepared subspace q xor qbar=1, so Z7Z9=-1 and T8=Y8. Therefore the pulse flips x8 and leaves every other physical bit fixed. Its phase is (-1)^(old x8). It swaps the q,qbar occupations, leaves all eight data occupations fixed, and does not act on any old Record site e0,...,e3. e8 is still a live bridge when recorded. Its removal disconnects the remaining path, so the final Record is permanent under the surviving native hopping terms.

For history z and final bit b the ideal branch map on the prepared carrier is
  M(z,b)=Q8,b U^c Q3,x3 Q2,x2 Q1,x1 Q0,x0.
Sum M(z,b)^*M(z,b)=I on the whole even-code space, since U^c is unitary and each event is a complete projective instrument. An outcome-register isometry is Vpsi=sum_(z,b) M(z,b)psi tensor |z,b>. This is an explicit finite isometry, not a relabeling of observed outcomes as a new physical measurement. The final Q8 is essential.

## Exact truth table and coherence scope

Let H=(a1+b1+c1+d1) mod2. Before the controlled pulse x8=x3 xor H, since q=0. Afterwards
  x8=x3 xor H xor c=H xor floor(L/2).
But F=(L+2(a1+b1-c1-d1)) mod4, whose high bit is exactly H xor floor(L/2). Hence e3 stores F mod2 and e8 stores floor(F/2), both as physical native Z Records. The checker exhausts all 256 labels, verifies every recovered data occupation, every old Record, the pulse guard and phase, and uniqueness of all 256 output physical codewords.

For fixed low history the conditional pulse phase depends only on H and therefore only on the final high Record bit. It does not resolve individual high occupations. Nevertheless the first four Records reveal the low occupations separately: superpositions with equal flux but distinct low data generally decohere when histories are discarded. The claim is nondemolition preservation of the orthogonal input basis and an isometry retaining complete history, not coherent Lüders measurement of flux alone. The output retains data as well as the two flux Record sites; it does not compress 256 states into four states.

## Load-bearing control, locality and energy imports

This is a controlled native instrument sequence. It does not evolve under an unmodified fixed H_R. Generic surviving hopping terms would move the high data and references. Setting the dwell to zero during the first four events, activating only T8 for the conditional pulse, and suspending the pulse interaction for the final sharp event are supplied bond selection and switching assumptions. No prior result is imported as proving that this selective control is available. With selected Hamiltonian g T8, g>0, the active duration is pi/(2g). Its physical Pauli support is the three consecutive edge sites e7,e8,e9, not a two-site physical nearest-neighbor gate. CAR adjacency and bounded whole-hop support are explicit; a two-site bounded-strength hardware synthesis is not proved.

The controller reads four already formed permanent signs and chooses one of two pulse actions. It contains a nonlinear sixteen-entry rule and a timed schedule. This is an explicit finite classical control resource, not a native Toffoli or an autonomous computation derived from the axioms. Initial preparation, ready Record apparatus, prescribed event occurrence and controller coupling are likewise premises.

The ideal selective unitary/projector calculation is not an energy ledger. Switching a Hamiltonian is generally work; the energy change of forming/deleting a Record edge requires its modeled battery apparatus. If a nonzero incoming hopping remains active at the final event, the usual independent-ready normalizable battery lift averages rotated effects and does not inherit this exact sharp truth table. The earlier battery obstruction cannot simply be bypassed by naming the pulse a control. This construction therefore isolates a positive information-processing bridge and identifies selective native hopping plus compatible work/Record apparatus as the remaining physical import. No exact finite-battery success probability or energy-conservation claim is made.


## Proof provenance and remaining import

The single-event proof was frozen at SHA612bf0a75361f0889fe437286bbf36ec587e43a1d7262a4da06933b1029b1d87 and independently reviewed by the native worker. The positive construction was preregistered separately, checked on all256 basis inputs, frozen at SHAe7852a0c4b168df912725a097e64213c72860de8e966f394c7e3769121a0f96b and independently reviewed by root. The original code, raw outputs and unsuccessful direct-two-event route remain recoverable at the frozen original PR head named below. This cohesive note is a retrospective port, not a new preregistration. The canonical scripts add output/resource metadata without changing those truth tables.

The bridge gained here is a physical output Record on a native orthogonal carrier. The unresolved premise is bond-selective, timed native control with a compatible preparation/work/Record apparatus. The already formed low-sign history feeds a supplied finite controller; its nonlinear rule is not hidden as an axiom-derived quantum gate. No theorem about an autonomous finite closed apparatus or arbitrary coherent flux instrument is claimed.

The canonical scope checklist below preserves the original route boundaries. Original preregistrations, source and review history remain recoverable at PR #8015 head `99bf0f1984aff1a9cd1fde5cc1ef4f667a046544`, under `.claude/science/physics-loops/native-flux-record-20260907/`. Historical reviews assign no current source or audit status; the canonical runners reproduce the finite matrices and truth tables under `--json`.

## Direct low-bit then high-bit native protocol fails on both branches

This is a scoped extension of the frozen one-event result, not a no-go for arbitrary adaptive parity circuits. Use the exact first Record of the four-low-mode component parity on the nine-mode path. The deleted bridge splits off that component permanently. Subsequent native quadratic dwells have no hopping term joining it to the high-bit/reference component. Permit any quadratic unitary on the four-low-mode component, separately chosen for each first outcome, followed by one native bridge event there. This is a superset of its actual available path controls.

Restrict the inputs to high bits all0. Define d=(+1,+1,-1,-1), D=diag(d) on modes(a0,b0,c0,d0). The target high-bit sign on a low occupation subset I is
F(I)=(-1)^floor(|I|/2) product_(i in I)d_i.

An observed bridge parity after the conditional dwell is eta Gamma(R), R a Hermitian one-particle reflection; eta is any known old-Record/output-sign convention. The first measurement fixes |I| modulo2 but leaves every basis state in that parity sector as a legitimate input.

Even branch: vacuum forces eta1. The complete two-particle sector must be diagonal with eigenvalues -d_i d_j. Diagonality of Lambda²R forces R diagonal, as in the frozen proof. Then the product of pair signs on any triangle must+1, while the target's three minus factors give-1. Impossible. The all-occupied state is not needed for the contradiction.

Odd branch: the complete one-particle sector requires eta R=D, hence R=eta D. On the three-particle sector the same measured operator is eta Lambda³(eta D)=Lambda³D because eta^4=1. But the target is -Lambda³D. Impossible. This argument permits separate arbitrary controls and sign conventions on the two branches; it is not defeated by simple feedforward from the first low-bit sign.

Thus the direct two-Record proposal (first actual low-bit bridge, then one conditionally Gaussian-preprocessed bridge for the high bit) fails on each branch. Reading a bridge in the OTHER component cannot fix it: with all high inputs0 and a fixed low parity, that component has the same reference occupation for all allowed low configurations. Input-independent local dynamics there cannot distinguish their differing high flux values. There is no rejoining interaction after the native deletion.

Extra parity measurements inside the low component, additional prepared matter modes, a controller that accumulates more outcomes, and a physically realized output write remain possible. This theorem does not classify them. In particular, the nonlinearity of a postselected multi-mode parity projection is not denied.

This branchwise boundary also applies when the first low-bit cut is an exact unlifted Record, the incoming second-event Hamiltonian is block diagonal across that deleted cut, and the second event uses a freshly independent ready full-line battery. Then each battery fiber is one of the separately allowed Gaussian controls, and a common input-independent measure plus the finite full-measure intersection argument preserves the deterministic sign-only obstruction. No extension to a general shared-battery lift of the whole two-event history is established here: incoming conjugation can change the first measurement, and the battery can be correlated after it. Reading correlated apparatus/matter or a cap-refusal outcome remains outside the proved readout contract.

## Finite controller escape: what is constructive and what is still imported

One can read all eight original path-edge Z Records, preserving every occupation-basis input and recording all its information. On the native path, the physical signs are prefix occupation parities p_i. The supplied controller can reconstruct n_i=p_i xor p_(i-1), with p_-1=0, and update a four-state accumulator by weights(1,1,-1,-1,2,2,-2,-2) modulo4. Including the previous parity and a nine-position program gives at most72 classical controller labels. This is exact arithmetic on actual prior Records, but it is NOT a native high-flux Record: simply reporting the accumulator would change the readout contract to a multi-Record classical function.

A physical output can be written conditionally in a prepared one-particle two-mode native component: a real hopping pulse swaps its endpoint occupations, and a subsequent bridge-Z event reads the chosen endpoint parity. Two such output components can be obtained from a four-mode even-parity path prepared with one particle in each pair and a middle bridge recorded odd. An additional even recorded bridge can separate this apparatus from the nine-mode data path. This supplies actual native matrices (two-mode hopping Pauli X and a native Z projector), not a Toffoli gate. The data Records remain unchanged. However, the controller's nonlinear accumulator/update and conditional pulse occurrence are supplied resources, not derived from the native instrument or the Admissibility law.

There is also an energy obstacle to calling this an exact compiler under the already modeled shared-battery law. A nonzero two-mode hopping Hamiltonian does not commute with the output Z projector. Its standard full-line energy lift averages conjugated parity effects over the ready battery Fourier density. Starting from a sharp endpoint, the intended outcome probability is(1+Re K(2t))/2, where K is the battery translation overlap. For a normalizable nonzero L² energy packet and nonzero translation2t, |K(2t)|<1: equality in Cauchy–Schwarz would require a translation eigenfunction of constant repeated magnitude, impossible in L² on the full line. Hence this naive pulse-then-lifted-Record write is not exact. This is about the specified standard independent-ready lift, not every energy apparatus.

Turning the hopping off before the Record would remove that measurement commutator, but the switching/control-work interface must then be explicitly constructed. Declaring a degenerate H0 writer or an arbitrary supplied controlled gate would import the missing apparatus dynamics and is not pursued as a publication result. Correlated programmed apparatus, a different exact energy-conserving fixed-input transition, or a quantitatively approximate writer with the existing finite-battery bounds are separate possible routes.

Thus this account identifies a conditional finite controller-to-physical-output strategy, but does not pretend that native parity measurements alone performed nonlinear flux arithmetic or that exact energy/locality was solved. The useful present result is the native branch-local two-event obstruction; an exact compiler including the required energy/control apparatus remains unfinished.

## No-Go Discipline Gate

N1 — Actual routes are generic-gate rejection, native low-bit success, Gaussian one-event failure, direct conditional second-event failure and positive controlled five-event escape. They are not five independent universal no-go families.

N2 — The negative carrier has9 CAR modes and256 even-code inputs. The positive has12 modes with declared q/qbar/reference/anchor preparation,256 basis inputs and five bridge events. Arbitrary coherent flux-only instruments are outside scope.

N3 — The exact one-shot discriminator is triangle signs(-,+,+), incompatible with diagonal one-particle reflection products. The exterior-square argument justifies reducing arbitrary Gaussian controls to that finite contradiction. The positive discriminator is final physical x8=highparity xor lowcarry.

N4 — Native Q and bridge law are imported from the parent; preparation, occurrence, finite controller, selective hopping, timing and work interface remain explicit. No Toffoli, set-readout or quantum-link phase bridge is silently imported.

N5 — Primary checks256 inputs,36 pair states and8 sign controls. Helper checks256 inputs and8 local Pauli actions. Analytic proof carries universal claims; no finite battery or full Hilbert controller simulation is performed. Both scripts have180second/180MiB limits and pure JSON/default scope output.

N6 — Nonbridge fairness does not erase output correlations. One-shot failure does not forbid adaptive schemes. Five-event success leaks extra low information, has three-edge physical hopping support, and is not autonomous or energy-complete. The old dimension70/128 boundary is carrier-specific.

N7 — Native independently reviewed the frozen one-event proof; root independently reviewed the positive proof. Author port and exact checkers are not billed as independent reconstructions. Review and original bytes are preserved.

N8 — Larger encodings, correlated apparatus, nonquadratic controls, alternative readouts and coherent protocols are different tasks. No universal compiler impossibility or physical flux law is claimed. This is conditional support with independent audit still required.
