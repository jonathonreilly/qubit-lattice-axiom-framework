# Unique minimizing flux on finite even cubic tori

**Date:** 2026-09-08
**Type:** bounded_theorem
**Status:** conditional-support

The supplied uniform full-native Hamiltonian at zero electric penalty has exactly one minimizing Z2 flux orbit on every finite rectangular cubic torus whose three extents are even and at least4. Its native flux is π on every elementary square and positive on each straight winding. The proof uses strict equality in reflection positivity and propagation of the boundary CAR algebra through each half lattice. It needs no size-specific numerical spectrum or Schmidt determinant.

## Premises and exact result

Use the [optimal-flux and exact-dispersion theorem](NATIVE_ZERO_PENALTY_OPTIMAL_FLUX_DISPERSION_NOTE_2026-09-08.md), [full fixed-flux endpoint](NATIVE_ZERO_PENALTY_ENDPOINT_NOTE_2026-09-08.md), and [Gauss/CAR carrier dictionary](NATIVE_DYNAMICAL_CYCLE_FERMION_Z2_DICTIONARY_NOTE_2026-09-08.md). Their supplied uniform hopping t is nonzero and all electric-penalty coefficients are zero. The auxiliary complex full-Fock hopping energy equals twice the native fixed-flux energy. It is this equality of optimization objectives, not a Hilbert-space equivalence, that permits use of the auxiliary reflection problem.

The parent identifies a canonical minimizer using the explicitly imported [Macris–Nachtergaele reflection theorem and tensor construction, Section2](https://arxiv.org/html/cond-mat/9604043). It verifies all reflection cuts and the generating set of elementary squares plus straight windings. The strict-equality argument below is additional; no uniqueness assertion is attributed to that paper and no historical novelty is claimed.

For each fixed finite graph, every noncanonical Z2 orbit has energy strictly above the canonical one. Finitely many such orbits imply an existential positive separation Δ_flux. No number is assigned to Δ_flux and no bound uniform in volume is proved. The canonical active gap is 4|t|sqrt(Σ_a sin²(π/L_a)); together with Δ_flux it isolates the full zero-penalty ground family. Its multiplicity is2^(N/2−1), where N=L_0L_1L_2. Unique flux orbit therefore does not mean a unique native many-body ground. Nonzero electric penalty, infinite volume and physical selection of the Hamiltonian remain separate questions.

## 1. The exact reflection tensor form

Choose a coordinate cut into equal half-tori of m=L_a/2 layers. Its two boundary layers are paired with their reflected counterparts by single crossing bonds. The MN half-Fock/Jordan-Wigner and right particle-hole transformations, followed by a local gauge, give

H(A,B)=A⊗I+I⊗B−sum_mu C_mu⊗C_mu.

A,B are Hermitian number-conserving half hopping quadratics (right particle-hole changes its hopping sign/conjugation). Every C_mu is a positive real multiple of a boundary annihilator or creator in a real occupation-basis CAR representation. Both members of each adjoint pair occur with the same positive weight. Therefore the sum is Hermitian. Vectorization sends the interaction to -sum C_mu X C_mu^T=-sum C_mu X C_mu†. The distinction between transpose and adjoint is harmless ONLY because these channel matrices are real. Complex phases remain in A,B, not in C_mu.

The half tensor identification does not introduce a missing entangling transformation: the d-generators on the left differ from its usual CAR representation by a unitary within the left matrix algebra, and the right generators form its independent CAR algebra. Right particle-hole and phase changes are also half-local. All statements about rank or gauge intertwining are made in these explicitly specified tensor coordinates.

## 2. Every positive reflected ground matrix is strictly positive

Consider H(A,bar A). A positive semidefinite coefficient matrix X of a normalized ground vector satisfies

A X+X A−sum_mu C_mu X C_mu†=E X.

Such a nonzero positive ground matrix exists by the same matrix modulus inequality used in MN: replace any ground coefficient matrix by its left/right positive moduli; their averaged energy cannot increase, hence each is also a ground vector.

For v in kerX, sandwich the eigenmatrix equation with v. The A terms and right side vanish, leaving sum_mu ||X^(1/2) C_mu†v||²=0. Thus each C_mu† preserves kerX. Adjoint pairing means all boundary creation AND annihilation operators preserve it, so their algebra reduces kerX. Applying the eigenmatrix equation to v now makes every interaction term vanish and yields X A v=0. Hence A also preserves kerX; A is Hermitian, so this is a reducing subspace.

Boundary CAR together with A generate the FULL half CAR algebra. Start with both outer layers. For a known site x on the inward frontier, [A,c_x] is a linear combination of neighboring annihilators. All transverse neighbors and the outward neighbor are already known; there is exactly one inward unknown neighbor y until the fronts meet. Its nonzero hopping coefficient allows solving for c_y. Adjoint gives c_y†. Peel whole layers successively. For m=2 every site is boundary already. This proves generation for every m>=2, irrespective of interior hopping phases. The irreducible full Fock CAR algebra has no proper reducing subspace. Since X is nonzero, kerX is not the whole space and must be zero.

Thus EVERY nonzero PSD ground coefficient matrix of a reflected half Hamiltonian has full rank. Neither uniqueness of that ground nor a no-zero-mode assumption was needed. This is stronger than the earlier canonical Slater rank certificate; that certificate remains a separate verified L6 illustration.

## 3. Saturation forces boundary-fixed unitary equivalence

Let X=U Sigma V† be a ground coefficient matrix for H(A,B). Put Y=U Sigma U† and Z=V Sigma V†. Direct cyclic-trace expansion gives the energy defect

E_(A,B)(X)−[E_(A,bar A)(Y)+E_(bar B,B)(Z)]/2
 = (1/2)sum_mu ||Sigma^(1/2)(U†C_mu U−V†C_mu V)Sigma^(1/2)||_HS².

A/B terms cancel. The channel identity is the elementary weighted square identity; paired real channels ensure the original expectation is its real part. This establishes equality conditions without asserting that a many-body hopping matrix is entrywise positive.

If the original flux is a global minimizer, both reflected child energies equal that minimum by MN's inequality and global minimality. The displayed trial energies must also attain it, and all squares vanish. Y and Z are PSD reflected ground matrices, so Section2 implies Sigma invertible. Hence R=U V† commutes with EVERY boundary channel. Subtracting the right-child eigenmatrix equation from the original equation after multiplication by R† gives

(R† A R−bar B)Z=0,

therefore R† A R=bar B. This is exact, with no unknown energy scalar because both ground energies are the same. Consequently the original is equivalent to a reflected child by a half-system unitary fixing all boundary CAR generators.

## 4. That unitary is a site gauge, in any number of layers

Let R† A R=C be an equivalence between half hopping quadratics, where R fixes all boundary annihilators. Initially the known modes are those boundary modes. Double CAR commutators of A with two known modes recover their hopping entries, so the corresponding entries of C agree after the already-known site phases are accounted for.

At each inward-frontier site x, its hopping commutator has only one unknown neighboring mode y. Subtract known contributions and divide by the nonzero coefficient. One obtains R†c_y R=z_y c_y, where |z_y|=1 follows from the CAR and equal hopping magnitudes. All frontier sites at that layer determine their respective phases; any second determination is consistent because it comes from the same R. Incorporate those phases and iterate. Thus R acts by site phases on every mode. Irreducibility makes it equal to that gauge implementer up to a scalar. Its boundary phases are1, so it changes no cross-plane bonds. The original full hopping assignment is therefore gauge equivalent to the reflected child.

## 5. Unique canonical orbit

The reflected child has canonical flux through every basic circuit crossing the chosen reflection cut. Gauge equivalence means the original has these fluxes too. A minimizing original can be tested against EACH coordinate cut; every elementary square and every straight winding crosses an admissible such cut. Therefore all its basic fluxes are canonical. The established generating-set argument identifies one gauge orbit. This direct argument does not need to assume an arbitrary minimizer already has a faithful Slater state or to carry out a reflection sequence.

The canonical assignment exists in the native Z2 family and attains the larger U(1) minimum. Thus a native Z2 minimizer is also a minimizer of the larger phase problem, and the argument applies. For connected graph, two Z2 sign assignments related by a U(1) site gauge with all edge ratios±1 are also related by a Z2 site gauge after removing one global phase. Hence uniqueness is also exactly uniqueness of the native orbit.

The canonical auxiliary Slater vacuum is indeed unique: its all-antiperiodic magnetic momenta have no simultaneous zeros (in fact each sin factor is nonzero at finite even extent), so the one-particle spectrum has no zero. This agrees with, but is not necessary for, Section2. Native spectator multiplicity remains as in the full dictionary. At any fixed finite graph and nonzero uniform hopping, finitely many Z2 orbits plus strict uniqueness imply an EXISTENTIAL positive flux-sector separation. The proof supplies neither its value nor a volume-independent lower bound. At zero hopping every orbit ties and the theorem is inapplicable.

## Canonical evidence and limitations

The [science packet](work_history/repo/review_feedback/pr8054-evidence/kept/pr8054-HANDOFF-9ef67db77ea9ef6f.md) preserves the complete derivation, independent cold and root reviews, exact lemma controls and the earlier L6 determinant route. The live primary executes finite exact controls for the complex SVD identity and the two layer-peeling mechanisms. These controls test algebra and implementation; the proof for every even size is the analytical induction above, not an extrapolation from tested widths. No physical flux enumeration or sampling is used.

At t=0 all flux orbits tie, so nonzero hopping is indispensable. The half-width is at least2; size2 axes with repeated bonds are excluded. Reality and adjoint pairing of the boundary channels, positive cross weights, equal graph structure and nonzero inward hopping are used explicitly. The result gives conditional support for the supplied model and does not remove its Hamiltonian-selection premise or establish a thermodynamic gauge phase.

The [canonical runner cache](../logs/runner-cache/native_even_torus_flux_isolation_2026_09_08.txt) records the current bounded execution; archived source reviews and campaigns retain their historical meaning.

## No-Go Discipline Gate

**N1 — Counterroutes and provenance.** ATTEMPTED — extending the L4 Jensen argument to L6 failed historically through the canonical variance. ATTEMPTED — enumerating eight windings addresses only the flat family. ATTEMPTED — positive-semidefinite kernel control with the full CAR algebra succeeds in the all-size proof. ATTEMPTED — faithful-child backward propagation supplies the successful L6 precursor. ATTEMPTED — direct each-cut gauge rigidity supplies the general proof. These are the recorded analytical routes and declared controls, not five new executions.

**N2 — One inference boundary.** The failed finite extrapolations are not independent impossibility walls. Their limitations are resolved by the subsequent general rigidity argument.

**N3 — Premises.** The supplied uniform native model, finite rectangular geometry with each extent even and at least four, nonzero hopping and exact gauge/active dictionary remain premises. External mathematical reflection tools are used only with the hypotheses checked in the proof.

**N4 — Distinct gaps.** Finite-volume isolation, the active excitation gap and spectator degeneracy are different statements. A positive finite-volume wrong-orbit separation is not a uniform thermodynamic lower bound.

**N5 — Resolution certificate.** The runner executes5955 finite lemma controls plus one coverage guard and one resource guard. The all-even reflection/kernel/rigidity proof is analytical; finite tested widths are not its extrapolative justification.

**N6 — Scope and imports.** Retiring the L4-only argument does not introduce a new framework axiom or establish Hamiltonian selection. The full finite-volume theorem remains conditional on its supplied model.

**N7 — Strongest continuation.** A local nonzero-electric-penalty conditional/history estimate requires additional analysis beyond this zero-penalty isolation theorem; it is not ruled out by the failed Jensen route.

**N8 — Historical limitations.** The L6 and general-even limitations of earlier finite arguments were retired by the delivered proof. They are preserved as history, not permanent obstructions.
