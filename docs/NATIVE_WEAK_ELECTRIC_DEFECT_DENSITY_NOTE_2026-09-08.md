## Result and prerequisites

Use the [certified uniform cubic stiffness](NATIVE_UNIFORM_CUBIC_FLUX_DEFECT_STIFFNESS_NOTE_2026-09-08.md), [full native electric dictionary](NATIVE_DYNAMICAL_CYCLE_FERMION_Z2_DICTIONARY_NOTE_2026-09-08.md), and [zero-penalty endpoint](NATIVE_ZERO_PENALTY_ENDPOINT_NOTE_2026-09-08.md). Work on the full physical carrier, without a low-charge projection. The auxiliary hopping unit is h=2|g lambda|>0. U>=0 is the coefficient of the actual positive electric operator D=sum_v(deg_v-3)^2. Let K_def count noncanonical elementary magnetic plaquettes, N=L^3 and L=4M with M>=32.

Every ground-state density operator of H_U obeys

    <K_def>/N <= min(3, (102400/387)*(U/h),
                       75*(204800/1161)^2*(U/h)^2).

The quadratic term improves the linear term when U/kappa_g<1/50, where kappa_g=1161h/204800. It applies to mixed as well as pure ground states.

For the full physical Gibbs state at beta*h>=200, put c=3*beta*h/800. Then

    <K_def>/N <= 800*(U/h)+2*log(8)/(c*N)
                    +6*log(1+exp(-c/2))/c.

A second thermal bound is available. Set kappa=3h/800, c=beta*kappa, x=U/kappa and A=log(8)/N+3*log(1+exp(-c/2)). Then

    <K_def>/N <= min(3, 3*x+2*A/c,
                       [sqrt(75)*x+sqrt(75*x^2+2*A/c)]^2).

At fixed finite beta the positive thermal floor produces a linear cross term in U; this is not a pure O(U^2) thermal statement. As the floor vanishes, the last upper envelope tends300*x^2. The separate ground theorem is stronger and does not rely on that limit.

Both bounds may be capped by3, the total number of elementary faces per vertex. They are useful density bounds when their right sides are small. They neither exclude every defect nor prove contour stability, a phase, a uniform spectral gap or pure-winding selection. No commutation of D with H0 is assumed; D in fact changes magnetic flux. The proof avoids the shrinking finite-size gap condition entirely.

## Complete derivation and source history

The full independently reviewed derivation follows. Its initial400 ground bound is a valid conservative intermediate bound; the later sharpened coefficient102400/387 is the theorem stated above. Its scratch-source references are historical provenance, with the canonical load-bearing sources linked above. No numerical Gibbs or perturbed-ground-state computation is used.

# A volume-uniform weak-electric defect-density bound without a spectral gap

This is a new analytic consequence, not a nonzero-U phase theorem. Sources read: final canonical uniform stiffness note bed02a2a089591081fbd72c855eb7b4dfc3ffc5b60e709e621e148e7ead00163, the full native dictionary's electric/low-domain distinction, zero-penalty endpoint's parity and static-sector discussion, and native-zero-penalty-spectator-lifting/DERIVATION.md electric expansion. The supplied full carrier and H_U=H_0+U D are retained; U>=0. No low-charge projection is added.

## Exact electric input and the surviving observable

On the six-valent graph D=sum_v (sum_(e incident v) n_e-3)^2 =3N/2+(1/2)sum_v sum_(e<f incident v) Z_e Z_f. Thus 0<=D<=9N on the FULL carrier. Let K_def=sum_p (1-S_p)/2 with the canonical sign absorbed so that it counts defective plaquettes. These commuting projectors remain a well-defined observable at U>0, although their sectors cease to be invariant.

Every nonconstant electric pair flips two distinct incident link-X signs. On these cubic tori that pair is not a gauge cut. Consequently it maps each fixed magnetic flux orbit to an orthogonal orbit. For every density operator block diagonal in magnetic orbit, its expectation is zero. In particular <D>_rho0=3N/2 for the U=0 Gibbs state at any beta, and <D>=3N/2 for a chosen canonical-flux ground state. This statement does not require a spectator choice or an active gap. It is not the assertion that D is scalar as an operator.

## Ground-state density: a positive result independent of winding gaps

Suppose the zero-temperature local stiffness is kappa_g>0. The fixed-orbit energy bound upgrades to the FULL operator inequality

    H_0 >= E_0 I + kappa_g K_def.

Indeed H_0 and K_def are simultaneously block diagonal in flux, and the bound holds for the lowest energy in every block; higher active states only increase it. It remains valid on arbitrary coherent superpositions of flux blocks. Pure winding blocks have K_def=0 and create no contradiction.

Use a canonical ground state as a variational trial for H_U. Then

    E_U <= E_0+(3/2)U N,
    kappa_g <K_def>_(ground,U) <= (3/2)U N.

The second inequality follows from positivity of U D, without perturbation series, a unique ground state or any gap. It holds for every H_U ground-state density operator. At M>=32 the accepted delta_inf>=3/50 and quadrature loss give delta_(ground,L)>3/100; conservatively kappa_g=3h/800 is available. Hence

    <K_def>/N <= 400 U/h.

This is useful when U/h is small; it is a bounded-density result, not exact absence of defects. The existing small-size argument supplies an existential all-cubic positive kappa_g, but no explicit numerical minimum is assigned to it here.

## Thermal density by quantum relative entropy

Let rho_U and rho_0 be the FULL physical Gibbs states at the same beta. Gibbs variational principle, using rho_0 as trial, gives F_U-F_0<=U<D>_0=(3/2)UN. Therefore

    S(rho_U||rho_0)=beta(F_U-F_0-U<D>_U) <= (3/2)beta U N.

Because K_def commutes with H_0, the variational entropy inequality for s K_def is particularly direct:

    s <K_def>_U <= S(rho_U||rho_0)+log Tr(rho_0 exp(s K_def)).

Use the already proved U=0 global moment bound, valid for 0<s<beta kappa_beta:

    <K_def>_U/N <= [(3/2)beta U +log(8)/N
       +3 log(1+exp(-(beta kappa_beta-s)))]/s.

With s=beta kappa_beta/2 this is

    <K_def>_U/N <= 3U/kappa_beta
       +2log(8)/(beta kappa_beta N)
       +6 log(1+exp(-beta kappa_beta/2))/(beta kappa_beta).

For M>=32,beta*h>=200 the accepted theorem permits kappa_beta=3h/800. The weak-U contribution is then800 U/h. This is volume-uniform apart from an explicitly vanishing finite-size term; no claim of a spectral gap or convergence of perturbation theory enters. It proves small mean local-defect density in the supplied perturbed Gibbs model. It does not transfer native reflection positivity to U>0.

The entropy inequality can be proved without an external concentration theorem: form sigma=exp(log rho_0+sK_def)/Z_s, use S(rho_U||sigma)>=0 and rearrange. Commutation makes Z_s the stated classical flux moment. All states are finite-dimensional and rho_0 is faithful at finite beta.

## What fails, and the next discriminating obligation

A global isolated-ground perturbation theorem would require U||D|| small relative to a finite-size isolation gap. Here ||D||<=9N, the active gap closes and wrong winding gaps are O(h/L), so that sufficient route has a shrinking U window. Failure of that sufficient condition is not proof of instability. The density estimates above avoid it entirely.

The entropy argument cannot preserve the contour tail at fixed U: its relative-entropy cost is extensive, so a binary event estimate can spend O(beta U N) on one local event. Neither the U=0 orbitwise free-energy penalty nor the global moment bound implies a uniform exterior-conditioned repair inequality. D mixes flux blocks, hence a fixed-flux free-energy comparison is no longer a sector decomposition of H_U.

A concrete next target is a local insertion bound for the imaginary-time expansion of U(D-3N/2), uniformly in volume: control connected flux-changing pair histories near a prescribed defect set, with denominator/time-integral decay priced by their defect energy and with cancellations/active bath treated explicitly. Such a bound must remain valid at repeated flux returns and arbitrary gapless active excitations; replacing each intermediate resolvent by the ground defect penalty is invalid on an unrestricted energy window. No such local bound is assumed here. The exact inequalities above are already positive tractable support; contour stability remains a sharper separate obligation.

## Sharper explicit ground coefficient and proof of the electric selection rule

At zero temperature and M>=32, delta_(ground,L)>=3/50-4*(3*pi²/(8*M²)). Using pi²<10 gives delta_(ground,L)>3/50-15/1024=1161/25600. Hence kappa_g=1161*h/204800 is a safe lower bound and

    <K_def>/N <= min(3, (102400/387)*(U/h),
                       75*(204800/1161)^2*(U/h)^2).

The quadratic term improves the linear term when U/kappa_g<1/50, where kappa_g=1161h/204800. It applies to mixed as well as pure ground states.

The preceding400 bound remains valid but is weaker. The thermal800 coefficient is unchanged because its temperature budget is different.

Here is a direct all-size proof that the electric pair has zero diagonal flux block. Every edge of a cubic torus with extent L>=4 belongs to four distinct elementary plaquettes. Two distinct incident edges share at most one elementary plaquette: perpendicular directions share one when compatible, and collinear edges share none. This is true also at L=4, since the forward and backward neighbor are distinct and no elementary square repeats an edge. Thus some elementary plaquette contains exactly one edge of the pair. Z_e Z_f anticommutes with that plaquette's magnetic loop. A gauge cut intersects every cycle evenly, so the pair cannot be a cut. This proves its vanishing expectation in every orbit-block-diagonal state, with no chosen gauge representative. It also proves D mixes flux; the identity <D>=3N/2 cannot be promoted to D=(3N/2)I.

## Why the factor eight is exact as an overcount

For the periodic cubic cell complex, a link Z2 gauge class with prescribed elementary plaquette products, if consistent, has exactly eight possibilities distinguished by the three independent winding Wilson loops. The ratio of two solutions is a flat1-cochain; quotienting by vertex coboundaries gives H¹(T³;Z2)=(Z2)^3. This includes all flat winding sectors; no parity or spectator factor removes them. Each compatible assignment with k defects therefore contributes at most8 times the reference weight exp(-beta*kappa*k). Bounding compatible assignments by all subsets of the3N faces yields

    Tr rho0 exp(s K_def) <= 8*(1+exp(-(beta*kappa-s)))^(3N).

The denominator is bounded below by ONE canonical orbit's weight. The factor8 is deliberately not canceled against an unproved equality of winding weights. This overcount is safe for nonzero s and includes the canonical zero-defect term. The expectation of D in rho0 uses block diagonality, not an assumption that only the minimizing winding orbit occurs.

## Full quantum entropy derivation and precise imports

For finite-dimensional faithful rho0=exp(-beta H0)/Z0 and rhoU=exp(-beta HU)/ZU, direct logarithms give

    S(rhoU||rho0)=Tr rhoU(log rhoU-log rho0)
                 =beta(FU-F0-U Tr rhoU D).

The Gibbs variational principle follows from nonnegativity of quantum relative entropy, with no commutation of D and H0. Its trial rho0 gives FU-F0<=U Tr rho0D. For s>0 define sigma_s=exp(log rho0+sK_def)/Tr exp(log rho0+sK_def). Nonnegativity S(rhoU||sigma_s)>=0 gives the variational entropy bound used above. Since [K_def,H0]=0, the normalizing trace equals Tr rho0 exp(sK_def). No Golden–Thompson reversal, classicalization of rhoU, or commutation of HU with K_def is used. Quantum relative entropy nonnegativity and the finite-dimensional Gibbs variational principle are standard imported mathematics; the new content is their application to the native electric selection rule and certified flux moment.


## Complete independently reviewed quadratic strengthening

Original source SHA-256 `c1d077595ce20a2693e3ee167abd1d5c06deafd35cab4d0c9c23b3b4655b03fc`; historical pending-review status below is superseded by the preserved independent review. This strengthens only the ground-state conclusion.

# Quadratic weak-electric ground-state defect-density bound

Status: new exact support derivation, conditional on supplied native model and accepted U0 uniform stiffness. Independent review pending. This strengthens the previously derived linear mean-density estimate; it does not give a nonzero-U phase or contour bound.

Let K=sum_f P_f count bad elementary plaquettes and H0>=E0+κK on the full physical carrier. Let HU=H0+UD, U>=0, D=3N/2+V, V=(1/2)sum_j W_j. There are15N incident-edge pairs j, with W_j Hermitian unitary and with each term flipping its affected plaquette signs. The canonical-flux trial state has <V>=0, so EU<=E0+3UN/2.

For any state ρ, including a mixed ground state, and any face f flipped by j, W_j anticommutes with S_f=I−2P_f. Hence P_f W_j P_f=Q_f W_j Q_f=0, Q_f=I−P_f. Hilbert–Schmidt Cauchy–Schwarz gives |TrρW_j|<=2sqrt(p_f(1−p_f))<=2sqrt(p_f), p_f=TrρP_f. Explicitly the cross term Tr(sqrtρ P_f W_j Q_f sqrtρ) has the two squared norms TrρP_f and TrρQ_f. This does not assume a product state, flux diagonality, or a spectral gap.

Each vertex has12 perpendicular incident pairs and3 opposite pairs. A perpendicular pair flips6 faces, because each edge belongs to4 faces and the two edges share exactly1; an opposite pair flips8. These statements include the L=4 periodic seams: opposite lattice neighbors remain distinct, two adjacent collinear edges share no elementary face, and perpendicular incident edges share exactly one face for every L>=4.

A fixed elementary face has4 edges and4 corner vertices. Counting incident pairs containing exactly one of its edges gives24 perpendicular pairs and8 opposite pairs: at each corner each of the two face edges pairs with three nonparallel edges other than its partner in that face, giving6 perpendicular pairs per corner; it pairs with its single opposite edge, giving2 opposite pairs per corner. Such a pair has a unique common endpoint, so no further multiplicity occurs.

Average the bound for W_j over its m_j affected faces before summing:

 |<V>| <= sum_j (1/m_j) sum_(f flipped by j) sqrt(p_f)
       = (24/6+8/8) sum_f sqrt(p_f)
       = 5 sum_f sqrt(p_f)
       <= sqrt(75 N <K>).

The lattice has3N elementary faces. This is a state-independent expectation estimate, not an operator inequality with a nonlinear function of K.

For any HU ground-state density operator, the trial bound and H0 stiffness yield

 κ<K> + U<V> <= 0,
 κ<K> <= U sqrt(75N<K>).

If <K>=0 there is nothing to divide; otherwise division and squaring give

 <K>/N <= 75 (U/κ)^2.

Combine with the independent positivity-based linear bound and the exact maximum K<=3N:

 <K>/N <= min(3, 3U/(2κ), 75(U/κ)^2).

For cubic L=4M, M>=32, the accepted density certificate and π²<10 give κ=1161h/204800, hence the explicit quadratic coefficient is75(204800/1161)^2 multiplying(U/h)^2; the linear coefficient is102400/387. For all cubic sizes a positive existential κ exists by the earlier small-size argument. Neither a unique ground state nor a uniform active/winding gap is required.

The same nonlinear estimate controls <V> in thermal states, but this note does not claim that the ground-state variational cancellation transfers without an entropy remainder. The already established finite-temperature relative-entropy linear bound remains separate. A local contour or phase theorem is not inferred from small mean density.


## Full independently checked thermal-root strengthening

Root proposed this route before the independent derivation; no claim of unexposed discovery is made. Frozen independent proof SHA-256 `4a312eec4521a6385a1e1c7786aab0d684c4d5d855aa95e92542e44ba7f6ca1f` follows in full.

# Independent thermal quadratic consequence

Root exposed the candidate inequality before this derivation; this is an independent algebra/scope review, not an unexposed discovery. No physical computation. The existing state-independent expectation bound |Tr rho V|<=sqrt(75N Tr rho K) and U0 magnetic moment theorem are inputs. H_U=H0+U(cN I+V), c=3/2, U>=0; all Gibbs states are full physical finite-dimensional states at the same positive beta.

Let rhoU and rho0 denote their Gibbs states. Direct logarithms, without commuting Hamiltonians, give

 S(rhoU||rho0)=beta(FU-F0-U cN-U<V>U).

The rho0 variational trial has <V>0=0, so FU-F0<=U cN. Consequently S<=-beta U<V>U<=beta U sqrt(75N<K>U). Nonnegativity of S also implies <V>U<=0 for U>0, consistently with this estimate. No classicalization, Golden–Thompson step or commutation of V and H0 occurs.

For 0<s<beta*kappa, [K,H0]=0 allows the entropy variational inequality

 s<K>U<=S+log Tr rho0 exp(sK).

The existing moment theorem gives log moment <=log8+3N log(1+exp(-(beta*kappa-s))). Put d=<K>U/N and A=log8/N+3log(1+exp(-(beta*kappa-s)))>0. Thus

 s d <= beta U sqrt(75d)+A.

Set y=sqrt(d)>=0. The quadratic s*y²-beta U sqrt75*y-A has one nonnegative root. Since s>0, the inequality is equivalent to

 d <= [(beta U sqrt75 + sqrt(75 beta² U²+4sA))/(2s)]².

At s=beta*kappa/2, with x=U/kappa and c=beta*kappa,

 d <= [sqrt75*x+sqrt(75*x²+2A/c)]²,
 A=log8/N+3log(1+exp(-c/2)).

This can be minimized with3 and the earlier bound3x+2A/c. It is valid for any state-independent kappa certified for the U0 thermal moment, in particular kappa=3h/800 at M>=32,beta*h>=200. At U=0 the expression equals2A/c, the original entropy-moment floor. At fixed x and beta->infinity with kappa fixed, the upper expression tends300x². This is an upper-bound limit, not a convergence statement about states; it is weaker than the separate zero-temperature75x² bound. For nonzero thermal floor the expression has a cross term linear in U, so it should NOT be described as a pure O(U²) bound at fixed finite beta. The correct claim is a quadratic-root bound that approaches a quadratic upper bound as the floor vanishes.

No nonzero-U reflection positivity, contour bound, thermodynamic phase or uniform spectral gap is concluded. The existing full-carrier electric selection and native U0 moment assumptions are unchanged. The algebra and quantum ordering are sound.

## No-Go Discipline Gate

**N1 — Counterroutes and provenance.** ATTEMPTED — positivity of the electric penalty D gives the linear variational bound. ATTEMPTED — averaged anticommutation gives the stronger quadratic estimate. ATTEMPTED — global entropy and a moment bound give the thermal mean estimate. ATTEMPTED — a spectral-gap perturbation argument is unnecessary here, not proved impossible. ATTEMPTED — transferring zero-penalty reflection positivity or a mean bound to prescribed positive-penalty contours remains unestablished. These are analytical routes and the declared local controls, not five new state simulations.

**N2 — Mean versus events.** The mean-density estimates and a prescribed-contour estimate are different conclusions. Their distinction is not a count of independent impossibility walls.

**N3 — Premises.** The supplied finite native Hamiltonian, positive electric penalty D, stiffness input and stated thermal/variational assumptions remain explicit. No new physical selection principle is introduced.

**N4 — Residual boundary.** A small mean defect density does not provide a bound for every prescribed contour event. No such implication is inferred from the local controls.

**N5 — Resolution certificate.** The runner executes258 exact local, quadratic and thermal algebra controls. The volume-uniform variational and Gibbs-mean arguments are analytical; there is no perturbed-state solve or Gibbs sampling in this invocation.

**N6 — Scope and imports.** Avoiding a uniform spectral-gap argument retires an unnecessary import. It neither proves that approach impossible nor establishes a need for new axioms.

**N7 — Strongest open route.** A local positive-penalty conditional or history estimate could address prescribed events. That route remains open and is not supplied by the present mean-density theorem.

**N8 — Historical limitations.** The delivered mean bounds resolve their stated targets using the later stiffness input. They do not convert older contour or phase limitations into permanent impossibility claims.
