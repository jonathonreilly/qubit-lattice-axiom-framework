# Exact zero-penalty endpoint of the full native carrier

**Date:** 2026-09-08
**Type:** bounded_theorem
**Status:** conditional-support

At $U=0$, the supplied full native Hamiltonian decomposes exactly into static $Z_2$ flux sectors and free Majorana problems. The Gauss constraint fixes even total matter parity, and the unused Majoranas give an explicit residual degeneracy. This is an exact finite endpoint of a supplied model, not a selected physical theory or a phase determination.

## Exact statement and dependencies

Use the complete [CAR–Z2 Gauss dictionary](NATIVE_DYNAMICAL_CYCLE_FERMION_Z2_DICTIONARY_NOTE_2026-09-08.md) and its [native instrument algebra](NATIVE_EDGE_RECORD_MATTER_INSTRUMENT_AND_ENERGY_LEDGER_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-09-05.md). The dictionary's ice corollaries and stochastic source are not needed here. Let the graph be finite, connected, simple and loopless, with $v\geq2$ vertices and $e$ edges. For real supplied $g,\lambda_{ij}$, retain the entire edge carrier and set

\[
H=g\sum_{i<j}\lambda_{ij}A_{ij},\qquad
A_{ij}\longleftrightarrow-i\gamma_i\gamma_jX^g_{ij}.
\]

There are $2^{e-v+1}$ fixed cycle-flux sectors, each of dimension $2^{v-1}$. In a tree-gauge representative $\xi$, define the real antisymmetric matrix

\[
K_{ij}=-2g\lambda_{ij}\xi_{ij}\quad(i<j),\qquad K_{ji}=-K_{ij}.
\]

If $\operatorname{rank}K=2r$ and its positive frequencies are $\omega_1,\ldots,\omega_r$, the sector energies are

\[
E_{\boldsymbol n}=\sum_{a=1}^r\omega_a(n_a-1/2),\qquad n_a\in\{0,1\},
\]

with multiplicity $2^{v-r-1}$ for each active occupation pattern. Coincident pattern energies add multiplicities. All sectors together have dimension $2^e$. The following proof treats even and odd vertex counts and zero modes explicitly. The cubic physical lane uses its specified even graph; the odd triangle is a dictionary-domain control only.

## Supplied model

Set U=0 in the SAME supplied full native H=UD+g sum_(i<j) lambda_ij A_ij, with real coefficients. Retain the full edge carrier, no hard charge or fixed native-cycle restriction. Use the exact8038 dictionary A_ij=−i gamma_i gamma_j X^g_ij on the all-positive Gauss space, G_i=P_i^f product_(e incident i) Z_e^g. This endpoint statement does not identify a physical coupling or phase, nor a limit of the low-charge two-species model.

Let the finite graph be connected, simple and loopless with v>=2 vertices and e edges. The cubic lane has even v; the argument also covers odd v in the parent dictionary domain. Choose a spanning tree. The link-X values xi_e=±1 label the redundant link basis. Local gauge transformations flip xi on their incident stars and act on matter by P_i^f.

## Gauge quotient and exact dimensions

Connectedness implies that the action on link-X configurations has kernel consisting only of the identity and the product of all vertex gauge transformations. Thus each link orbit has2^(v−1) elements, and there are2^(e−v+1) orbits. Products of xi along cycles label those orbits; a tree gauge sets every tree xi to+1, leaving the chord fluxes as independent signs.

The stabilizing product of all Gauss transformations acts on matter as total fermion parity. Invariance therefore requires EVEN matter parity. For any even Fock vector psi and chosen tree-gauge representative xi, the normalized sum over the2^(v−1) distinct gauge transforms of psi tensor|xi> is a Gauss-invariant vector. Its summands have orthogonal link states, so this is an isometry. Conversely, any Gauss-invariant vector on the orbit is determined by its coefficient at one representative, which must have even parity. This proves surjectivity and does not replace Gauss constraints by an informal gauge choice.

Every flux sector is therefore exactly an even-v-mode Fock space of dimension2^(v−1). Multiplying by2^(e−v+1) gives2^e, the whole native edge dimension. All sectors occur; neither an odd-matter sector nor an extra global gauge qubit is present.

The gauge-invariant Hamiltonian acts under this isometry as

H_xi=−ig sum_(i<j) lambda_ij xi_ij gamma_i gamma_j
     =(i/4) sum_ij gamma_i K_ij gamma_j,
K_ij=−2g lambda_ij xi_ij for i<j, K_ji=−K_ij.

The factor2 follows because the double sum has two equal contributions per unordered edge. Link fluxes are constants of motion at U=0. This fixed-flux decomposition is exact, not a mean-field treatment of a fluctuating link field.

## Energies and residual degeneracies

A real orthogonal transformation brings the real antisymmetric v-by-v K into r nonzero2-by-2 blocks [[0,omega_a],[-omega_a,0]], omega_a>0, and v−2r zeros. The transformed active Majoranas obey the same Clifford algebra. For each nonzero pair define d_a=(eta_(2a−1)+i eta_(2a))/2. Then

H_xi=sum_(a=1)^r omega_a(d_a†d_a−1/2).

An orientation change of an individual pair exchanges d with d†; the full energy multiset is unaffected. The frequencies are the positive eigenvalues of iK (equivalently the nonzero singular values of K, one per pair). A single edge with coupling g lambda has omega=2|g lambda| and energies±|g lambda|, fixing the convention.

There are v original spectator Majoranas bar_gamma_i=i(c_i†−c_i), none appearing in H. Along with the v−2r active zero modes they leave2(v−r) zero Majoranas, or v−r zero-energy fermionic degrees of freedom. Since r<=floor(v/2), at least one zero fermion remains. For every fixed occupation pattern of the r active modes, imposing even TOTAL matter parity removes exactly half the2^(v−r) zero-mode states. Hence each active occupation pattern has multiplicity

2^(v−r−1).

This is a precise pattern multiplicity. If different active patterns yield the same numerical energy, their multiplicities add. At generic full active rank with even v, r=v/2 and this becomes2^(v/2−1). If active zero modes occur it increases; at K=0 it becomes2^(v−1), as required. For odd v at maximal rank r=(v−1)/2 it is2^((v−1)/2). No claim that the individual spectator Majoranas are physical observables is required: a single spectator changes parity, while the dimension count concerns allowed even combinations and the residual Clifford module.

In each flux sector the bottom energy is −(1/2)sum_a omega_a with exactly the residual multiplicity above (unless additional active frequencies vanish, already included by reducing r). The global bottom is the minimum over all2^(e−v+1) flux sectors. The derivation gives a finite exact optimization problem; it does not solve that optimization on a cubic lattice or import a flux-phase theorem in three dimensions.

## Relation to finite coupling and interpretation

The zero-penalty endpoint has exact static flux sectors and extensive spectator degeneracy. A nonzero UD term need not preserve this decomposition and is not covered by the free endpoint solution. No continuity of a phase, protection of a photon, thermal preparation or realization of free propagating physical particles is inferred. The supplied native Hamiltonian remains the physical premise. The exact diagonalization and gauge quotient are standard finite Clifford mathematics, not a novelty claim for free-Majorana theory.

## Live controls and provenance

The live helper uses only standard-library Gaussian rational arithmetic. The 80 counted checks comprise 79 mathematical/domain/count predicates and one resource check. The mathematical predicates compare native oriented-cycle projected traces with an independently constructed even-CAR representation, check characteristic polynomials of iK and analytic energy moments, and enforce the global even-parity domain. No eigensolver is used in the live path. The triangle and square fixtures cover odd vertex count, active zero modes, full-rank active modes and the factor two in K.

The original historical author driver recorded three isolated subprocess mutations failing: a missing K factor, an odd-parity Gauss domain and an incorrect spectator multiplicity. Odd and even spectra alone coincide in these fixtures because of spectator modes; the explicit global-Gauss-product check, not a fictitious spectral distinction, rejects the wrong domain.

The [durable packet](work_history/repo/review_feedback/pr8049-native-zero-penalty-evidence/pr8049-REVIEW_HISTORY.md) preserves the original54 SymPy controls and proof, independent508 gauge-average-isometry checks and their source-bound review. These are separate provenance, not added to the live80 count. The independent gauge-average check is not rerun by the primary. The root candidate exposure is declared; no historical novelty for Clifford diagonalization or gauge fixing is claimed.

The Hamiltonian, graph and coefficients remain supplied. No low-charge U1 domain is imported. No optimal cubic flux, phase, thermal preparation, physical particle interpretation, nonzero-U integrability or continuity of a phase follows. The global minimum remains an unsolved finite flux optimization in the general graph. No third-party PDF or external theorem is required for this finite proof.

The current bounded execution is recorded in the [canonical runner cache](../logs/runner-cache/native_zero_penalty_endpoint_2026_09_08.txt). The three historical mutation scripts are not launched by the current primary.
