# P2 buys the bridge and nothing else: the interface compresses to one obstruction — Cycle 902

Date: 2026-08-04

Authority: none

Audit: unset

Status: bounded worked result (owner-directed gravity-lane closure,
window 2; no axiom surface touched). The Cycle-894 residual ordering
said supply P2 first; this block supplies it. Verdict: **PARTIAL** —
the kernel coordinate buys the ENTIRE bridge (the four non-IF1
requirements jointly satisfiable on 12/12, with an exhibited object
of residual freedom zero) and buys NOTHING of IF1, which is now the
interface's terminal obstruction — and IF1's gap is a property of
the barrier, not the kernel.

Worker disclosure: authored by a Claude Opus 5 worker under supervisor
spec (substitution disclosed). The 878 pair vendored with digests
verified pre-commit. The CHECKER's first draft carried a real
solver-soundness bug (Bareiss-style elimination corrupting ranks on
rank-deficient matrices with skipped columns — caught by
cross-comparison, NOT by its own small-rank probes), fixed and
hardened with a solver self-validation tooth that cross-ranks every
real system by two routes; the fix and its lesson are disclosed for
propagation. Independent audit still required.

## Q1 — the minimal extension, computed

**Fibre dimension 5** = the exact rank of the realized
interference-spectrum matrix (108 rows: 9 holding windows x 12
configs) = D + 1 at walk depth 4 — TIGHT (no proper degree subset
carries the family; truncation obstructs exactly the two
degree-4-realizing configs; per-config ranks 1-4 disclosed —
minimality is a family-wide claim). The extension is solved over the
MAXIMALLY GENEROUS base so every verdict is independent of the 878
base rank (the Cycle-863 module is absent from this lineage —
computed scan, zero matches, disclosed; a generator relation derived
from the vendored primary's own text shows the five 878 generators
are not free).

**The property lift: five of six lift; SUPPORT FAITHFULNESS FAILS.**
The bridge forces zero mass on the 42 vanishing cells, and every one
of those windows CONTAINS supp(R) — so only the three
non-support-faithful members of the 878 five can carry the
extension. A computed obstruction internal to the P2 route, and the
exact reason IF5 costs something.

## Q2 — what P2 buys (the compression)

- bridge only (IF2/IF3/IF4/IF6): satisfiable on **12/12** configs;
- the theta-free regime (Cycle 894's): 5/12 — the frozen walks;
- adding IF1: **1/12** (the `single` config);
- all five jointly: **1/12**.

The sibling checker's ordering claim is CONFIRMED AND SHARPENED: P2
repairs exactly the seven theta-moving configs (identical to the
fine-grid theta-moving set) — its IF3 purchase is 7/12, the frozen
five never needed it. **The minimal obstructing subset is {IF1}
alone.** The IF1 gap (readout value vs seed mass, e.g. I = 13 vs
seed 1 on ball1) is IDENTICAL at every fibre point — theta cannot
touch it, because the amplitude's site support never moves with
theta. Both IF1 readings are reported (weak support-overlap: 7/12;
strong pointwise identification: 1/12).

## Q3 — the bridge, constructed

Bridge-independence is DEAD exactly as 894 predicted: with the
extension, the bridge equations determine the atom masses degree by
degree. Verified on all 648 grid points, zero violations, zero
negative masses. The exhibited object on `single`: four atoms with
exact coefficient tables, solution space one-dimensional with that
dimension ENTIRELY the normalizer — **residual freedom 0 once N is
fixed**. The surviving sub-grid uses only degrees {0, 2} (rank 2),
so the constructed object is over-provisioned relative to the
family-minimal fibre — disclosed as a scope note.

**The compressed obligation**: after P2, the Born-gravity interface
question is exactly IF1 — the disjoint-loci mismatch between the
linear readout (pinned to the records) and the quadratic weight
(expelled from them). And per the sibling Cycle-903 result, that
expulsion is BARRIER-CONDITIONAL — so the interface's terminal
obstruction is a barrier-scoped fact, to be read against the
containment family, not as an absolute.

## Checker

All six headline claims corroborated on fully independent machinery
(monomial vs Chebyshev basis; fraction-free integer elimination with
content removal vs rational RREF; reversed indexing; atoms by
iterative refinement vs signature bucketing; Z re-derived from the
amplitude field). Every per-config rank and kernel matches exactly.
The minimality claim stands in the second basis; the exhibited
solution survives substitution on all rows and grid points;
independent solution attempts on all eleven obstructed configs find
none. 9/9 teeth. The solver-soundness lesson (T9) is the block's
methodological export.

## Imports, derived, open

### Imports

- the 892 primary + receipt, the vendored 878 pair (digests verified
  pre-commit), the 885 primary, the axiom memo (all pinned,
  hard-fail preflight);
- the 894 residual ordering (cross-branch handoff, tested here).

### Derived

- the minimal fibre (dimension 5, tight) and the failed
  support-faithfulness lift;
- the satisfiability table with the {IF1}-only minimal obstruction;
- the constructed bridge object with residual freedom zero;
- the compression of the interface question to one barrier-scoped
  obstruction;
- the T9 solver-validation export.

### Open

- IF1 — the interface's terminal obstruction, now barrier-scoped
  (the next move lives at the barrier/readable-set identification);
- the 878 base rank (its census module absent from every G-lineage
  branch — a lineage-joining task for a future campaign);
- nothing else on the P2 route.

## Verdict

The ordering held: the kernel coordinate was the right thing to
supply first, and supplying it collapses four of the five demands
into a constructed object with no freedom left to price. What
survives is a single mismatch the kernel was never going to fix —
the linear world reads the records, the quadratic world is expelled
from them, and the size of the disagreement never moves with the
coordinate this block added. The interface question is now one
sentence long, and the sentence is about the barrier. Independent
audit still required.
