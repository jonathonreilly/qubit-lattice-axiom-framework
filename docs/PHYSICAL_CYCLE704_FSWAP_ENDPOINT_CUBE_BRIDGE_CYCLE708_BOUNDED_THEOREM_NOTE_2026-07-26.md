## Result

On one supplied open `2 x 2 x 2` cube, the Cycle-704 endpoint opportunity for
an exact dressed matter FSWAP has a bounded physical-M2 extractor after the
state is already in the declared PatchGraph/repetition code.

For the two transported endpoint modes,

```text
P_B = OR(B_u(before) != B_u(after), B_v(before) != B_v(after))
    = n_u XOR n_v
    = (1 - B_u B_v)/2
```

on the exact dressed-FSWAP occupation domain.  The finite signed tableau sends
`B_u`, `B_v`, and `B_u B_v` to pure-Z, rail-free PatchGraph words of weights
`6`, `6`, and `10`.  Cycle 707's literal placement preserves those weights.
A supplied blank pointer next to the selected seam then receives the ten-site
parity through a `242`-factor nearest-neighbor CNOT/SWAP route-and-return word.

This is a positive bounded selected-seam opportunity extractor.  It is not a
generic before/after comparator, an occurrence law, a physical predecessor
bank, a Record, an autonomous recurrent compiler, or a derivation of time.

## Exact conditional intertwiner

Let `T_g` denote the finite signed tableau map for a declared basis-gauge
choice `g`, `E_lit` the Cycle-707 literal PatchGraph/repetition isometry, and
`V_uv` the physical nearest-neighbor parity extractor for a selected seam
`(u,v)`.  If

```text
B_u B_v |psi_q> = (-1)^q |psi_q>,  q in {0,1},
```

then the executed code-space relation is

```text
V_uv (E_lit T_g |psi_0> tensor |0>_p)
  = E_lit T_g |psi_0> tensor |0>_p,

V_uv (E_lit T_g |psi_1> tensor |0>_p)
  = E_lit T_g |psi_1> tensor |1>_p.
```

The runner obtains zero unitarity, blank-pointer isometry, and eigenspace
projector residuals.  On a mixed-parity superposition, `V_uv` coherently
entangles the pointer:

```text
V_uv sum_q Pi_q |psi> |0>_p = sum_q Pi_q |psi> |q>_p.
```

It does not select a branch.  The dense abstract tableau `T_g` is not executed
as a local physical circuit in this result.  Cycle 708 physically executes
only `V_uv` on an already encoded state.

## Cube algebra and basis gauge

The open cube has `168` OpenReference graph-edge qubits.  The target has `156`
PatchGraph edges and `12` prepared single-Z rails.  The first direct extension
of the Cycle-706 row inventory contains `169` W rows at rank `168` on both
sides.

The runner and independent reconstruction find one exact positive relation:

- relation dimension `1` and weight `30`;
- `24` outward-corner cell triangles and all `6` cube faces;
- product `+I` on both source and target;
- deletion of any one of those `30` rows gives rank `168`, zero canonical
  failures, and `1,080/1,080` exact endpoint maps; and
- deletion of any of the other `139` rows leaves rank `167`.

The six face rows and 24 triangle rows form proper-cubic orbits of sizes `6`
and `24`.  There is no eligible row fixed by all frames.  A deletion label can
be carried covariantly with a supplied coframe, but a frame-invariant
single-row selector has not been derived.  This is a basis-gauge issue, not a
physical constraint deletion and not a preferred-plane-free full-tableau
construction.

Crucially, all endpoint images are identical for every eligible deletion.
The endpoint subalgebra therefore closes independently of this basis choice.
Cycle 708 claims covariance for that endpoint subalgebra and its transported
physical word, not for one frozen greedy tableau completion.  A symmetric
quotient or local redundancy-gauge circuit remains open.

## Literal physical resources

The Cycle-707 placement puts the 156 target edge qubits on `168` active M2
sites because each of the twelve stream edges uses a two-site repetition
pair.  Adding the twelve prepared midpoint rails gives `180` carrier/rail M2.

For every seam, the abstract and physical endpoint word weights are

```text
(weight(B_u), weight(B_v), weight(B_u B_v)) = (6,6,10).
```

The pair word has two pointer distances of `11` and eight of `13`, so

```text
sum_j d_j = 126,
sum_j [2(d_j-1)+1] = 242
```

nearest-neighbor factors.  The physical L1 and Linfinity diameters of the
three words are bounded by `11`, `13`, and `24`.

The twelve candidate pointer coordinates are distinct and do not collide
with any carrier or prepared rail.  Each certificate executes one selected
seam.  The twelve independent words contain `2,904` factors in aggregate,
but no simultaneous or overlap-safe twelve-seam schedule is claimed.  Their
coordinate union contains `812` routed sites and `832` sites after adjoining
the 180-site carrier/rail set.  Therefore `180` is not the physical extractor
footprint.

Eight selected-seam routes traverse their prepared rail and four do not.
All twelve rails have zero final-return failures.  Arbitrary routing
spectators are returned, not merely zero-initialized spectators.

## Domain controls: why this is FSWAP-specific

The static parity shortcut is correct because exact FSWAP changes the two
endpoint B eigenvalues precisely when their initial occupations differ.
The runner freezes three controls:

| domain | rows | mismatch or false-fire count |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| exact dressed FSWAP | 4 | `0` |
| unrestricted two-bit before/after pairs | 16 | `8` |
| unchanged diagonal/contact-like pairs | 4 | `2` |

For an unchanged `|01>` or `|10>` state, static `B_u B_v` parity is one even
though no B eigenvalue changed.  Therefore this word must be gated by the
declared FSWAP opcode/domain.  It cannot replace Cycle 704's general
before/after comparator.  Diagonal contact and general superposed coin
endpoints remain separate constructive tasks.

## Covariance, translations, and held control

The endpoint semantics and physical route family are checked under all `24`
proper-cubic frames and all `576` ordered products:

- `864` oriented endpoint rows, zero failures;
- `13,824` endpoint-label product tests, zero failures;
- carrier, prepared-rail, and routed-word frame/product diagrams, zero
  failures; and
- four translated diagrams, zero failures.

The transformed family uses the supplied coframe.  One frozen coordinate word
is not invariant: only one proper frame leaves the canonical routed word
equal, and no tested unit translation does so with the origin held fixed.
The basis-gauge warning above is load bearing: independently rerunning the
greedy deletion after rotation agrees with the transported deletion in only
`4/24` frames.  No full-tableau/drop covariance is inferred from endpoint
covariance.

The same algebraic basis rule is applied without refit to a held `3 x 2 x 2`
box:

| box | Open edges | Patch edges | rails | coarse rows | omitted rows | endpoint rows |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `2 x 2 x 2` | 168 | 156 | 12 | 6 | 1 | 36 |
| `3 x 2 x 2` | 256 | 236 | 20 | 11 | 2 | 60 |

Canonical and endpoint failures are zero.  This is a held tableau/endpoint
control only; it does not execute a held physical extractor or recurrence.

## Deletion, spectator, and unlawful-domain controls

The executed controls include:

- `12 x 1,024 = 12,288` endpoint truth rows with zero parity/return failures;
- `960` symbolic GF(2) basis rows with zero arbitrary-spectator or wire-return
  failures;
- `120/120` active parity-CNOT deletions detected;
- the first route SWAP deleted on each seam, `12/12` detected;
- zero nearest-neighbor failures;
- all 12 protected rails returned; and
- explicit rejection of empty, duplicate, disconnected, unknown-drop,
  under-drop, over-drop, non-ten-site support, and occupied-pointer inputs.

## Supplied, derived, and open structure

Supplied:

- the open cube chart, origin, proper-cubic coframe, cell/port order, and seam
  orientation;
- a carried basis-gauge deletion label and deterministic symplectic
  completion convention;
- the already prepared PatchGraph, local-D, repetition, and rail-Z code
  sectors;
- the exact dressed-FSWAP opcode/domain;
- the Cycle-707 repetition logical-Z side;
- one blank pointer M2 for the selected seam, blank route-work sites, a fixed
  x-y-z Manhattan order, support order, and CNOT order; and
- numerical tolerance and deterministic test vectors.

Derived and executed on that surface:

- the unique rank relation and all 30 eligible basis deletions;
- the deletion-independent 36-row endpoint subalgebra;
- the 168-to-180 carrier/rail placement and physical endpoint supports;
- the selected-seam 242-factor nearest-neighbor opportunity extractor;
- exact eigenspace/projector intertwining, arbitrary-spectator return, active
  deletions, and unlawful-domain controls;
- endpoint/physical-word 24/576 covariance and translated diagrams; and
- the algebraic `3 x 2 x 2` held control.

Open and not claimed:

- a bounded local circuit implementing the abstract tableau `T_g`;
- local genesis and dynamical enforcement of the PatchGraph, repetition,
  local-D, rail, pointer, and routing-work sectors;
- an intrinsic deletion selector or symmetric redundancy-gauge circuit;
- an overlap-safe simultaneous all-seam schedule;
- the general before/after physical comparator, diagonal-contact endpoint, and
  superposed-coin endpoint;
- a literal physical predecessor/interval bank and its address, freshness,
  write, head/rotor, and uncompute circuit;
- occurrence/admission, Record permanence, Born/history actualization, or an
  empirical duration identification;
- one translation-invariant recurrent physical law; or
- a global physical-site compiler, no-go theorem, minimum-resource theorem,
  shared obstruction, or axiom pressure.

No circuit index, factor count, pointer value, or packet ordinal is called
time.  The opportunity pointer is not called a Record.

## No-Go Discipline Gate

**Gate result: FAIL for a broad negative.  Disposition:
`partial-attempt-with-named-untested-routes`.  Retain the positive bounded
FSWAP endpoint theorem and its exact domain controls only.**

### N1 — normalized route families

| family | object / mechanism / terminal obligation | status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| static FSWAP parity | initial `B_u B_v`; FSWAP identity; selected-seam physical extraction | attempted; succeeds boundedly |
| general two-snapshot comparator | before/after B registers; reversible XOR/OR; physical snapshot acquisition and cleanup | abstract Cycle-704 comparator exists; physical route open |
| opcode-sensitive endpoints | update-tagged contact/coin observables and returned work | diagonal control attempted; general route open |
| direct OpenReference placement | avoid PatchGraph/rails and route the 168 native edge qubits | untested |
| local bond-elimination Clifford | bounded circuit for the abstract signed tableau | untested |
| literal predecessor bank | physical address, freshness, payload write, head/rotor update and inverse | software adapter exists; physical bank open |
| recurrent cellular controller | overlap-safe prepare, extract, append, and uncompute on growing volumes | untested |

The live target-equivalent and stronger routes forbid a route-independent
negative.

### N2 — wall-independence audit

The exact candidate obligations are:

- `W_domain`: FSWAP versus general before/after/contact/coin semantics;
- `W_chart`: graph representation, coframe, order, and basis gauge;
- `W_transport`: pointer placement, routing, rails, and schedule;
- `W_genesis`: code, rail, pointer, and work preparation;
- `W_bank`: address, freshness, write, inverse, and cleanup; and
- `W_recurrence`: overlap-safe growing-volume operation.

All 15 unordered pairs are inventoried, but no bidirectional intervention
establishes substrate independence for any pair.  Finite transport closes
without a bank, and the Cycle-704 software bank closes without physical
transport, but neither result proves independence from genesis or recurrence.
N2 therefore blocks a shared-wall claim.

### N3 — hidden-input scan

The supplied list above exposes the FSWAP opcode, occupation/local-D sector,
positive code characters, chart, port and edge order, bond orientation, basis
gauge, free-zero symplectic completion, pitch, origin, coframe, stream owner,
repetition-Z side, pointer rule and blank state, route-work domain, Manhattan
axis order, support/CNOT order, and absence of a simultaneous schedule or
physical bank.  “Canonical” means algebraic basis consistency, not an
intrinsic physical chart.

### N4 — exact residual matching

| target | executable result | disposition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cycle-704 FSWAP opportunity | `0/4` mismatch; projector residual `0` | closed on exact FSWAP domain |
| general before/after shortcut | `8/16` mismatch | rejected for static parity |
| unchanged diagonal shortcut | `2/4` false fires | rejected for static parity |
| cube signed bases | rank `168`; 30 eligible deletions; `1,080/1,080` endpoint maps | finite algebra closed |
| literal endpoint support | weights `6/6/10`; no rail support | closed |
| selected-seam physical extractor | 242 NN factors; `12,288` truth rows and 960 symbolic rows; zero failures | closed conditionally |
| endpoint/word covariance | 24/576 and translations; zero diagram failures | closed for transported family |
| full frozen-tableau covariance | greedy drop mismatches transported drop in `20/24` frames | not claimed; carried gauge required |
| local tableau circuit and preparation | no executable witness | open |
| physical bank and recurrence | no executable witness | open |

### N5 — resolution and rhetoric audit

The positive state is one supplied cube and one selected seam per execution.
The held `3 x 2 x 2` result is algebraic only.  No finite support, gate count,
rank relation, or held row is promoted to an asymptotic minimum or global
compiler theorem.  “Cannot” applies only to the explicitly tested static
parity shortcut outside its FSWAP domain.

### N6 — partial-closure path

The endpoint subalgebra, literal support, selected-seam extraction,
spectator/rail return, covariance, and domain controls remain useful without
closing tableau locality, genesis, bank implementation, or recurrence.  These
are positive imports retired from the Cycle-704 physical endpoint interface.
No new axiom is required for this partial closure.

### N7 — steelman

A concrete next route is an opcode-controlled reversible endpoint transducer.
On FSWAP it uses the ten-site static parity word.  On diagonal contact it
writes zero or a separately declared contact observable.  On a general coin
it acquires pre-update B ancillas, applies the update, computes post-update
deltas, and uncomputes the snapshots.  A bounded local bank stores the old
head/rotor and endpoint bit before comparator cleanup.  A fixed seam coloring
prevents overlapping routed supports.  The decisive artifact is a literal
compute-append-uncompute M2 circuit with a collision-free bank, followed by a
no-refit growing-volume trace, 24/576 covariance, and returned-work tests.

This steelman is live, so a broad negative fails.

### N8 — cross-cycle echo

Cycle 704 explicitly left physical placement and bank execution open; Cycle
708 partially retires placement/extraction while keeping the bank open.
Cycle 706's failed natural relabeling was not promoted to a no-go because the
signed tableau route succeeded; likewise, static parity's domain failure does
not rule out the general comparator.  Cycle 707's finite controller and
genesis admissions remain admissions here.  None is relabeled as derived.
