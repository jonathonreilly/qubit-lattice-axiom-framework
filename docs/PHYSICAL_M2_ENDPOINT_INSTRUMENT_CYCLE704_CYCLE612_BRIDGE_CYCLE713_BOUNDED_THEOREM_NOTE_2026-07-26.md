## Result

The Cycle-712 direct PatchGraph state isometry can emit a coherent
matter-change opportunity pointer from the same decoded seam update.  For one
internal seam with decoded endpoint occupations `n_1,n_6`, three clean M2
registers `(d_u,d_v,p)` are added.  Before the adjacent-CAR seam word, the two
occupations are XORed into `d_u,d_v`; after the seam they are XORed again, and
an exact reversible OR writes

```text
p = OR(d_u,d_v) = n_1 xor n_6.
```

Four further CNOTs use the swapped output occupations to return `d_u=d_v=0`
while retaining `p`.  Define `E_ext = E tensor I_(du,dv,p)` and the clean-input
injection `E_0 |psi> = E|psi> tensor |000>`.  On that declared code space the
instrument satisfies

```text
G_physical E_0 |psi>
  = E_ext G_instrument (|psi> tensor |000>).
```

with `p` a coherent candidate opportunity.  It is not an occurrence selector,
actualized branch, clock tick, Record, or probability variable.

## Exhaustive logical certificate

The runner executes the actual gate objects in the literal
prewrite/nine-FSWAP/postwrite/OR/cleanup/contact segment on all 4,096 seam
basis rows, then composes that executed map with an independent creator-wedge
construction on every two-cell matter source column.  The complete coin,
reverse, adjacent seam, contact, and retained-pointer output has maximum `EG`
residual `8.121767085755588e-16`, maximum norm residual
`3.1086244689504383e-15`, and zero number leakage.  Literal gate census,
ordering, one-output support, CAR/contact phase, and auxiliary-wire checks all
have zero failures.  On every seam basis term:

- the Cycle-704 `B`-change predicate equals the retained pointer;
- the matter-delta word has Hamming weight `2p`;
- both delta scratch bits return to zero; and
- pointer-true weight ranges from zero to one over the column family.

Deleting the actual left-prewrite gate, including its dirty-scratch output, or
deleting the actual 15-factor OR Toffoli subword produces maximum column
residual `sqrt(2)`.  The exact 15-gate H/T/T-dagger/CNOT Toffoli
decomposition has residual `7.346882794269506e-16`; a primitive deletion has
residual `2.82842712474619`.

The old distant tensor-FSWAP shortcut is not used.  The endpoint is computed
around the nine-adjacent-FSWAP CAR seam that Cycle 712 independently verified.

## Literal physical execution

For two cells the complete repetition-decode, target-decode,
coin/reverse/seam/contact plus endpoint instrument, target-encode, and
repetition-encode word has:

- 39 Cycle-712 code/repetition M2 plus 3 endpoint-register M2;
- 1,400 primitive one/two-M2 gates;
- 17,798 routed nearest-neighbour gates;
- maximum route distance 24;
- 503 touched coordinates, including 461 blank route-work M2; and
- zero placement, nearest-neighbour, operand-order, route-return, decoded
  stabilizer, or scratch-cleanup failures.

Its routed digest is
`185fdb5270931877474ef720926bde016ff2fece03c1b8b58588e52e517d04f7`.

Without refitting, the held three-cell/two-seam word uses six endpoint
register M2 and gives:

- code dimension `262144 = M64^3`;
- 60 code/repetition plus 6 endpoint-register M2;
- 2,165 primitives and 38,829 routed gates;
- maximum route distance 40; and
- zero placement, routing, operand-order, route-return, or decoded-stabilizer
  failures.

Its routed digest is
`a1040745b93c60bf766b369d1c344f0ee7b5d3cd1e747ba5d561edb1e76de210`.
The two retained pointer bits remain separate outputs, one per internal seam.
The actual held literal segment is also executed on 289 rows: the complete
172-row `N<=2` sector plus 117 hostile high-occupation backgrounds.  It has
zero matter, number, pointer, scratch, phase-norm, support, gate-order, or
gate-census failure.  These 289 rows are a held literal truth domain, not an
exhaustive amplitude oracle over all `M64^3` columns.

The theorem domain requires clean `(d_u,d_v,p)`.  Each of the three single
dirty-ancilla inputs is explicitly rejected by that domain predicate and its
executed output differs from the clean output by `sqrt(2)`; the construction
does not silently promote dirty registers into lawful inputs.

## Proper-cubic and landed-interface checks

The endpoint XOR is transported through every one of the 24 proper-cubic
direction permutations on all 4,096 occupation rows, with zero truth-table
failure.  All 576 direction-permutation products compose exactly.  This is
decoded pointer naturality.  Literal routed physical words for every
transported chart remain outside this result, as already disclosed by Cycle
712.

The runner re-executes the unchanged Cycle-704 functions:

- all 128 reversible pointer rows invert exactly;
- all `4096 x 36` matter-column/directed-port cases have zero endpoint,
  B-pointer, delta, reference, or contact-false-positive failure;
- all 24 frame-port rows close; and
- one `B` word has weight at most 6, while the two-endpoint union has weight
  at most 11 across at most two owner cells.

The retained pointer truth semantics then feed the unchanged software
acceptance surfaces: Cycle-610 packet projection and interval failures are
zero, `9+12=21`, reversal is exact, and all 96 register inverse/carry cases
pass; Cycle-612 admits the consistent order, refuses the inverted
co-registration, and detects the forced cycle.

These latter packet and order operations remain host software in Cycle 713.
Only the matter-to-opportunity instrument is physically compiled here.

## Supplied, derived, and open inventory

Supplied:

- the Cycle-712 target code state, prepared stabilizer/repetition sector, and
  fixed coin/reverse/seam/contact order;
- three clean endpoint-register M2 per internal seam and blank route work;
- the fixed local seam association and proper-cubic chart convention;
- Cycle-704 binder and Cycle-610 actuality, admissibility, law-domain, bank,
  address, and orientation inputs on the software side; and
- the offline serial gate word and Manhattan route.

Derived and executed:

- a coherent seam matter-change opportunity pointer on the same joint `E`;
- exact H/T/CNOT decomposition of the OR Toffoli;
- clean delta scratch with one retained pointer per internal seam;
- literal routed two- and three-cell physical words;
- exhaustive 4,096-column instrument equality and active deletions;
- 24/576 decoded pointer naturality; and
- exact projection of its Boolean semantics into the unchanged Cycle-704,
  Cycle-610, and Cycle-612 acceptance functions.

Open and not claimed:

- objective occurrence or autonomous admission;
- a physical predecessor/rotor/freshness packet bank and selector;
- Record permanence—the landed software packet has an accessible inverse;
- autonomous clean-register, code-sector, and route-work genesis;
- recurrent many-star scheduling, exterior streams, and independently active
  local coframes;
- an empirical interval unit, physical time, or proper time; and
- source/gravity, Born/probability, or realized-history meaning.

The circuit ordinal is not read or stored and is not called time.  The pointer
is not selected or copied into a permanent Record.

## No-Go Discipline gate

No negative theorem ships.

- **N1:** direct same-`E` pointer succeeds; full before/after registers,
  local-`B` product controls, fixed-address packet circuits, finite-bank
  unrolling, and recurrent allocators remain live routes.
- **N2:** opportunity, occurrence, admission, permanence, empirical unit,
  bank allocation, and code genesis remain distinct obligations.
- **N3:** clean pointer M2, code sector, seam association, tokens, route work,
  and program order are explicit above.
- **N4:** the active deletions diagnose the endpoint word only; they are not
  substrate obstructions.
- **N5:** two and three open chains are tested; many-star, periodic, holed,
  and unbounded domains are not exhausted.
- **N6:** physicalizing the fixed packet cell and then a finite bank are
  immediate partial-closure paths.
- **N7:** a hostile steelman may accept the coherent pointer but reject any
  claim of occurrence until actuality/admission are autonomously generated;
  this note makes the same distinction.
- **N8:** Cycle 704's physical-B/software-packet boundary and Cycle 712's
  joint-`E` boundary are composed rather than redescribed.

Therefore there is no impossibility, minimum-content, shared-obstruction, or
axiom-pressure claim.

## TOE dependency effect

`C_local` narrows because the matter-to-endpoint map now shares the literal
Cycle-712 physical state isometry and update.  `C_int` narrows for the seam
opportunity but not diagonal contact, which remains endpoint-silent under
this predicate.  `C_wrap` is unchanged: packet integers and gate order are not
time.  `C_ref` and `C_num` retain the Cycle-711/712 chart and prepared-sector
boundaries.  `C_source` is unchanged.

## Prior-art and novelty boundary

Reversible XOR/OR circuits, Toffoli decompositions, coherent syndrome
pointers, stabilizer decoding, and nearest-neighbour routing are standard.
No global priority claim is made.  The new bounded result is their exact
composition on this repository's joint PatchGraph M64 compiler: a physical
CAR seam writes the same local matter-change opportunity used by the landed
causal-interval interface, with exhaustive all-column, held-overlap, routing,
covariance, cleanup, and deletion controls.
