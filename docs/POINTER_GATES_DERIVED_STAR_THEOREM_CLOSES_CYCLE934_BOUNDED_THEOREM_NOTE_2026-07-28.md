# One term runs both gates: the pointer side derived, and the star theorem closes — Cycle 934

Date: 2026-08-05

Authority: none

Audit: unset

Status: bounded worked result (owner-directed mass-lane capstone,
window 2b/3 boundary; no axiom surface touched). The last underived
component of the star certification structure — the pointer-side
gates — is DERIVED, and the COMPLETE STAR CERTIFICATION THEOREM
composes and verifies: from the frozen Hamiltonian, preparation,
statistic definitions, and grid (at its phase), every certification
verdict for a star follows from the 2(d+1) collective reduction.
The derivations: **H(Z_S) = 1 bit EXACTLY** — the global X-flip
symmetry commutes with H (commutator exactly 0) and fixes the
preparation, pinning the branch weights (promoting 932's disclosed
symmetry note to a lemma); **excess = chi identically** (chi(0) = 0
for ANY product preparation across the pointer/arm cut), so the
content gate reduces EXACTLY to the single-arm Holevo threshold
chi_1 >= 1 - delta; **t_open is degree-independent EXACTLY at zero
pointer field** with a closed form (t_open = arccos(c*)/2 =
0.596990388538; W = 0.376815549720 — 932's measured ~0.37), and
the ENTIRE degree-dependence of the gate is the pointer's own
transverse term — THE SAME TERM Cycle 933 ablated as the entire
source of arm entanglement. One term runs both sides of the gate.
The residual back-action carries a verified bound (spread <=
0.3150 lambda^2). Both t_close sides derive (the content side's
second crossing; the independence side = 933's C_ab crossing);
the clip switch matches 932 on 21/21 cells; **every edge of 932's
window is now derived.** The composed theorem reproduces all 40
pinned star cells x 3 deltas — 78 verdict rows, 741 per-sample
gate comparisons — at EXACT agreement, and a 10-cell seal
(including three fields appearing nowhere in the corpus) verifies
on the untouched full-space route.

Worker disclosure: authored by a Claude Opus 5 worker under supervisor
spec (substitution disclosed). Two spec discrepancies handled by the
stronger reading and published: the constants cross-check is
NINE-way, not the spec's miscounted "eight-way"; and the spec's
frozen-field seal cells CANNOT be holdout-free (prior receipts
publish those answers) — delivered as asked with the holdout claim
made only where true (six never-used-field cells). Seven self-caught
items disclosed in full, including two timing-digest traps (one in
each runner — the trap class's fourth and fifth occurrences this
window, both now hard-guarded), a tooth whose control refused to
fire because the lemma is STRONGER than first stated (scope
corrected, tooth redesigned), and a wall-clock scan that
hard-failed on the physics word "second" (keys renamed; the guard
stays maximally strict). Independent audit still required.

## The derivations

- **L0 (H_Z = 1 exactly):** P = the global X-flip commutes with H
  (exactly 0) and fixes the frozen preparation (defect exactly 0);
  P Z_0 P = -Z_0 forces <Z_0(t)> = 0 at every d, field, time
  (numeric max |H_Z - 1| = 1.1e-16 over 240 probes to lambda = 2
  and Jt = 5). Clause 1 of the content gate is unconditional.
- **L1-L2 (excess = chi; the gate reduces):** chi(0) = 0 for any
  product preparation across the cut, so the excess clause is
  implied with 0.88 bit to spare and binds nowhere; the content
  gate is EXACTLY chi_1 >= (1 - delta).
- **L3-L5 (the degree-independence, explained exactly):** at zero
  pointer field the branches are products of d identical qubits —
  rho_1^z is pure and d-FREE (spread 1.2e-14, the double-precision
  floor, vs ~2e-3 with the field on: eleven orders). The whole
  degree-dependence enters through the pointer's flip histories
  (collective overlap factors — the only place d appears), with
  the verified bound spread <= 0.3150 lambda^2 (the log-corrected
  form tested and found FLATTER without the log; the non-monotone
  ratio reported, not fitted away). **The chi side and the s(k)
  side of certification are the same Hankel object read two ways —
  entropy of a sum vs a sum of entropies — driven by one term.**
- **L4/L4b (the closed form and the lobe structure):** the
  zero-field window in closed form; and the checker's adopted
  finding — chi depends on t only through |cos 2t|, so the content
  gate is PERIODIC with period pi/2: one window per lobe, with the
  second lobe at Jt ~ 2.17-2.53 holding ZERO frozen grid points
  (no verdict anywhere is affected; the hypothesis list's window
  clause is scope-corrected to "one interval per content lobe",
  verified not assumed).
- **L6 (every edge derived):** content-side t_close = the second
  threshold crossing; independence-side = the derived C_ab
  crossing; the clip-identity switch (independence through d = 5,
  content from d = 6 at the high field) matches 932 on 21/21
  cells; t_open against every pinned 932 edge at 3.0e-13.

## The composed star certification theorem

Eleven hypotheses, exact: H1-H5 imported/frozen (the Hamiltonian,
preparation, partition rule, statistic definitions with their four
gate constants, and the sample grid AT PHASE 0 with run length 3
and deadline Jt <= 1); H6 geometric (arms pairwise isomorphic —
the reduction's honest boundary); H7-H10 derived (H_Z; excess=chi;
933's amplitudes; 932's counting law, lobe-scope-corrected); H11
numerical (resolutions; the checker re-ran 12.5x finer).
**Verification: exact verdict, run, and per-sample gate agreement
on all 78 rows / 741 comparisons; the edge-counting law equals the
direct per-sample count everywhere; the drift clause is vacuous on
stars (a corollary of L0).** 932's grid-phase qualifier is carried
unsoftened and RE-DERIVED from this block's own edges (the tooth:
threshold 5 at phase 0, 3 at +0.010). Nothing resisted derivation
at star scope; what stays imported is the frozen protocol itself,
the grid and its phase, and all non-star geometries.

## The seal

Ten cells at d in {9, 10}: both frozen fields plus THREE fields
appearing in no receipt and no prior seal in the corpus (0.0413,
0.0687, 0.1137 — independently verified absent by the checker).
The holdout claim is split honestly: the six never-used-field
cells are true holdouts (route N touched zero sealed cells before
the digest was fixed); the four frozen-field cells are NOT claimed
as holdouts (prior receipts publish those answers). Verification
on the untouched full-space route: zero verdict/run/per-sample
mismatches; max edge deviation 2.9e-13.

## Gates, teeth, checker

Restriction (before any new number): 917/919 star rows via the
pinned 33-function route executed verbatim — 2,262 values at
deviation exactly 0; 927 star rows via the pinned 25-function
route — 8,606 values at exactly 0; the 926 star point at 0; 932's
42 window edges re-derived at 2.55e-13 with zero label/verdict
mismatches and its 25 sealed star windows at 7.1e-13; 21/21
constants NINE-way quote-identical; the 932 vendoring
digest-verified against the ship receipt read from the source
branch. Primary: exit 0, 20.4 s; route S vs an own untouched
full-space route at 1.0e-14; Sym^d leakage 2.2e-16; dense
profiles on 21 cells x 281 points. Checker: SUPPORTED WITH
FINDINGS, 15/15 teeth, ZERO refutations, 11.5 s — disjoint
machinery including THE REDUCTION REBUILT BY SYMMETRISING
FULL-SPACE BASIS VECTORS (the primary's hand-written Dicke
elements themselves under test: agreement 4.4e-16), 50-digit
mpmath on an edge and a verdict row (7.1e-15), six named
assumptions hunted and discharged, and the rival readings beaten
quantitatively (chi peaks at 0.985 — not saturation; the pointer
field moves t_open 20.7x more than the arm field). Two findings
adopted mid-block (the lobe periodicity; the flatter lambda^2
bound).

## Imports, derived, open

### Imports

- the three frozen memos (all definitions byte-quoted); the
  917/919/926/927/932/933 packages (all reproduced at their
  pinned grades; 932 vendored with source-branch authority); the
  axiom memo (pinned).

### Derived

- H_Z = 1 exactly (the lemma); excess = chi; the content gate as
  the single-arm Holevo threshold;
- the exact zero-field degree-independence with the closed-form
  window, the lobe periodicity, and the back-action bound;
- both t_close sides and the clip switch — every 932 edge;
- the composed star certification theorem (eleven hypotheses; 78
  rows exact; sealed);
- the one-term mechanism summary.

### Open

- the non-star boundary (Cycle 937, running — the spider
  extension);
- the grid phase (imported by design; the owner's protocol);
- the frozen protocol objects themselves (imports by
  construction).

## Verdict

The lane's long derivation closes where it started: at the
pointer. The entropy that gates content turns out to be pinned at
exactly one bit by a symmetry nobody had cashed as a lemma; the
excess clause was the same inequality wearing a time-shift; and
the opening time every geometry shares is the physics of a single
arm — shared exactly, at zero pointer field, and blurred only by
the one term this lane has now met twice, running the entanglement
on one side of the certification and the gate's degree-dependence
on the other. With the relations, the clock, the amplitudes, and
now the gates all theorems, a star's certificate is no longer a
measurement — it is a computation from the frozen protocol, exact
to the last of seven hundred forty-one samples, sealed at fields
the corpus had never touched. What remains outside is exactly what
was chosen, not discovered: the protocol, its grid and phase, and
the geometries beyond the symmetric family — the honest border of
a theorem that now knows its own edges. Independent audit still
required.
