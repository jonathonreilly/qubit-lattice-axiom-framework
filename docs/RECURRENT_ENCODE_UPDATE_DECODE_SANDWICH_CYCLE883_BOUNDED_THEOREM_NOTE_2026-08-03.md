**Claim type:** bounded_theorem

**Authority:** none

**Audit:** unset

**Primary runner:** [Cycle-883 cold package acceptance](../scripts/frontier_cycle883_recurrent_encode_update_decode_sandwich_package_acceptance_2026_08_03.py)

**Scientific runner:** [Cycle-883 recurrent sandwich](../scripts/frontier_cycle883_recurrent_encode_update_decode_sandwich_2026_08_03.py)

**Independent checker:** [Cycle-883 independent check](../scripts/frontier_cycle883_recurrent_encode_update_decode_sandwich_independent_check_2026_08_03.py)

**Scope:** fixed open cubic `L=2` and held `L=3`, on the one supplied clean Cycle-870 embedding. No autonomous genesis or all-volume scheduler is claimed.

The direct premise surfaces are the four [Minimal Framework Axioms](MINIMAL_AXIOMS_2026-06-29.md) and the [Cycle-870 physical matter compiler](OPENREFERENCE_CUBIC_RECURRENT_PHYSICAL_M2_MATTER_COMPILER_CYCLE870_BOUNDED_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-08-02.md). The axioms supply only the physical `Z^3`/M2 setting. Cycle 870 supplies the compiled matter law, boundary/coframe, clean domain, serial word, `beta=-0.3`, and `g_contact=0.37`.

## Bounded theorem

Let `J_L` embed arbitrary raw logical matter into Cycle 870's one declared clean carrier/syndrome/controller/work state. Let `V_L` be its full emitted seven-stage returned-route encoder unitary, so `E_L=V_L J_L`. Let `U_L` be the executable routed update and `G_L` the native logical update. Cycle 870 cold-recomputes

```text
U_L E_L = exp(i phi_L) E_L G_L
```

for every input vector. Define the literal physical serial word

```text
S_L := V_L^dagger U_L V_L
```

(execution order `V_L ; U_L ; V_L^dagger`). Because the emitted inverse is the reverse-order canonical adjoint of every `V_L` gate,

```text
exp(-i phi_L) S_L J_L = J_L G_L.
```

The scalar chooses a formal vector representative; the executable channel is that of `S_L`. Its output lies in the same `J_L` domain with logically updated raw matter. Therefore, for every fixed nonnegative external invocation count `n`,

```text
channel(S_L^n J_L) = channel(J_L G_L^n).
```

This is algebraic induction from the all-vector intertwiner and restored domain, not a materialized `2^(6N)` matrix. `n` is not time, duration, or rate. Coherently controlling different invocation counts is excluded: the projective phase then becomes relative unless compensation is physically compiled.

## Executed ledger and controls

| fixture | `V` primitive/routed | `U` primitive/routed | `V†` routed | composite primitive/routed | support M2 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| open `L=2` | 3,889 / 48,913 | 17,048 / 173,352 | 48,913 | 24,826 / 271,178 | 5,228 |
| held open `L=3` | 15,473 / 207,027 | 61,038 / 703,550 | 207,027 | 91,984 / 1,117,604 | 20,138 |

Canonical composite site/matrix digests are `912ff53ed3e29976b5f5127f9126faee6c7340b1342396a039b06bc76a80ded5` (`L=2`) and `7128f62fe2bda19ba951ece5ccd61cf848e0d6019b46decf1532d2f16ff2f5e8` (`L=3`). Directly reconstructed `V`/`G` word hashes, exact support hashes, and exact transit hashes match both a cold `cube_fixture` replay and the pinned Cycle-870 receipt. `V†` touches exactly the `V` coordinate set. Every emitted gate is one-M2 or nearest-neighbor two-M2; routes return arbitrary, including entangled, transit state.

The runner separately asserts `V†V=I`, `V†VJ=J`, the one-epoch equation, returned `J` domain, and the two-epoch induction seed. It does not award residual zero to an unexecuted dense matrix.

Active controls:

- deleting all `V†` leaves each root `(fresh,token,spent)=(0,0,1)`: fresh/spent failures are `3+3` at `L=2` and `8+8` at `L=3`;
- applying adjoints in forward order leaves `(0,1,0)`: fresh/token failures are `3+3` and `8+8`;
- local wrong-order pairing fails `48,888` and `207,012` pairs, and deleting a selected nonidentity inverse gate has nonzero operator residual;
- all `180` (`L=2`) and `648` (`L=3`) single-carrier `X` errors violate at least one independently reconstructed vacuum row (minimum/maximum violations `1/12` and `1/16`); this is rejection evidence, not an admission circuit;
- all `21` and `56` dirty root patterns fail preparation, while the unlawful coarse syndrome is actively rejected;
- correct one/two-epoch phase residuals are zero. The wrong-sign residuals are `1.9826877958702498` and `1.9791101885206208`; controlled-invocation vector residuals are `0.9320457032293477` and `1.0696518958403711`.

The independent checker rebuilds the primitive inverse, routes it independently, reconstructs the Cycle-870 all-vector obligations, and repeats word/support/domain/phase controls without importing the primary runner.

## Physics and covariance

The equality preserves the complete supplied `coin/mass -> onsite reverse FSWAP -> every directed seam FSWAP -> contact` update. The inherited one-particle fixture remains analytic mass `0.4534056541748852`, rest mass `0.4534056541748851`, residual `1.1102230246251565e-16`. Those numbers remain conditional inputs, not selected laws.

The transported encoder, placement, and update retain zero failures for all 24 proper-cubic frames and 576 ordered products. This is code-space covariance on a supplied coframe, not a translation-compatible all-volume scheduler.

## Supplied, derived, open

Supplied:

- fixed finite open `L=2/L=3` box, spacing-16 origin, coframe, `J_L` clean state, and arbitrary raw logical input;
- Cycle-870 `V_L`/`U_L` serial order and external unconditional invocation;
- `beta=-0.3`, `g_contact=0.37`, boundary, and numerical law.

Derived here:

- literal routed canonical `V_L^dagger` and exact reuse of the `V_L` support;
- projective raw-domain recurrence, one/two-epoch proof seed, and all fixed unconditional powers by induction;
- complete return of preparation auxiliary and transit state after each word;
- transported 24/576 covariance of the composite diagram.

Open:

- first clean genesis, dirty-input admission/fault repair, and physical occurrence/start trigger;
- translation-compatible, volume-independent local scheduling of `V_L` and `V_L^dagger`;
- noncubic/periodic topology, Wilson sectors, and autonomous boundary/coframe choice;
- numerical-law selection and coherent phase-compensated invocation control;
- persistent encoded-bank architecture, time, source/gravity, permanent Record, Born/history, and predictions.

Static constraints are not energy; the formal scalar is not a gate, generator, rate, or observable; the returned raw bank is not a Record.

## Negative-promotion stress test

Cycle 883 is positive and bounded. The gate is **FAIL** for any impossibility, minimum-content, shared-obstruction, or axiom-pressure promotion.

**N1 alternatives.** Forward-only replay fails only its spent sector. The sandwich succeeds. Local spent refusal, alternating buffers, moving garbage/entropy rails, local stabilizer pumps, and direct endpoint-incidence preparation remain open. Fewer than five normalized families are closed, and one construction succeeds.

**N2 collapsed walls.** `C_D` (supplied clean fixed-box domain), `C_S` (supplied serial invocation), and `C_L` (supplied numerical law) are pairwise operationally distinct. Dirty recovery, topology, and downstream bridges are scope exclusions, not added theorem premises.

**N3 hidden-wall scan.** Boundary, coframe, clean banks, factor order, invocation, and parameters are explicit. Operator induction follows only from the all-vector equality and returned `J` domain. No standard-QFT, naturality, or registered-primitive shortcut is used.

**N4 residual match.** The `3/8` whole-inverse deletion and same-order root residuals directly test domain return; local inverse deletion tests gate activity; wrong-sign and controlled-phase residuals test projective scope. No parity, topology, time, Record, Born, or gravity residual supports this theorem.

**N5 rhetoric/resolution.** The positive equality covers all vectors only on the two declared clean fixtures. Controls reject only the stated words/domains. They exclude no other encoder, schedule, topology, pump, or repair law.

**N6 partial closures.** Constructive paths remain: a local all-volume scheduler, physical admission/refusal layer, periodic stabilizer preparation, autonomous trigger, or derived numerical law. None presently requires an axiom.

**N7 steelman.** A covariant local pump, endpoint-incidence preparation, or reversible double buffer could close genesis/scheduling while preserving injectivity. This cycle does not test those terminal constructions.

**N8 cross-cycle echo.** Earlier parity, chart, and role walls narrowed after representation changes. This cycle similarly retires forward-only replay by composition, so remaining boundaries stay implementation/supply gaps.
