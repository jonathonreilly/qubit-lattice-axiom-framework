# Source/Measure Planck-Action RN Source-Unit Bridge

**Claim type:** bounded theorem / exact support bridge.
**Role:** positive bridge candidate for the source-unit gap exposed by
[`SOURCE_MEASURE_LOG_SELECTION_BOUNDARY_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-05-30.md`](SOURCE_MEASURE_LOG_SELECTION_BOUNDARY_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-05-30.md).
**Status:** bounded support on the Tier-A Planck/action-unit surface; no
unbounded Y_T closure by this note alone.
**Primary runner:** `scripts/frontier_source_measure_planck_action_rn_source_unit_bridge.py`

## Load-Bearing Source Dependencies

- [`SOURCE_MEASURE_LOG_SELECTION_BOUNDARY_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-05-30.md`](SOURCE_MEASURE_LOG_SELECTION_BOUNDARY_THEOREM_NOTE_2026-05-30.md)
  — supplies the source-scale freedom that this bounded bridge narrows.
- `docs/ADMITTED_INPUT_REGISTRY_TIER_A_NOTE_2026-05-23.md`
  — records the Planck-mass conventional anchor used for the physical lattice
  scale. This note still treats the source-coupled Planck-action
  normalization as an explicit bounded-surface input, not as a derivation from
  the scale anchor alone.
- [`YT_LSP_SIGNED_RECORD_SOURCE_READOUT_SUPPORT_NOTE_2026-05-24.md`](YT_LSP_SIGNED_RECORD_SOURCE_READOUT_SUPPORT_NOTE_2026-05-24.md)
  — supplies the signed-record source/readout support used for the normalized
  top-source direction. The present note does not promote the downstream
  top-source identification.

## Theorem

On a physical finite lattice with a source-coupled action weight explicitly
written in Planck action units, the Radon-Nikodym natural source coordinate is
the dimensionless local action coefficient. This is a bounded bridge
conditional on that source-action normalization; it is not a derivation of the
normalization from the Planck-mass scale anchor alone.

Let the probability weight of a finite record configuration be

```text
P_0(omega) proportional exp(-S_0(omega) / kappa_Pl).
```

For a local signed-record source operator `O` normalized by

```text
E_0[O] = 0,
E_0[O^2] = 1,
```

the Planck-action unit deformation is

```text
S_h(omega) = S_0(omega) - kappa_Pl h O(omega).
```

Then

```text
dP_h / dP_0 =
  exp(h O) / E_0 exp(h O),
```

so the source score and Fisher norm at the origin are

```text
d log(dP_h/dP_0) / dh |_(h=0) = O,
I(0) = E_0[O^2] = 1.
```

Thus one Planck action quantum multiplying a unit signed-record source is the
same coordinate as the unit RN/Fisher source coordinate.

By contrast, a scaled deformation

```text
S_h^(lambda) = S_0 - kappa_Pl h lambda O
```

gives score `lambda O` and Fisher norm `lambda^2`.  It is a physically allowed
source in the action formalism, but it is not the primitive one-Planck-action
unit source coordinate unless `lambda = 1`.

## What This Adds To The Boundary

The log-selection boundary proved that finite record probability calculus
alone leaves a `lambda` family.  This note supplies the missing positive
identification on the action side:

```text
dimensionless action coefficient in units of kappa_Pl
  = RN natural source coordinate.
```

Equivalently, the RN score is not an extra convention once a source-coupled
local action in Planck units is accepted.  It is simply

```text
score = - d(S / kappa_Pl) / dh - E[-d(S / kappa_Pl) / dh].
```

The result is compatible with the Tier-A scale convention
`docs/ADMITTED_INPUT_REGISTRY_TIER_A_NOTE_2026-05-23.md`:
the physical lattice has the Planck-mass anchor `a^{-1}=M_Pl`.  The
source-coupled action exponent `S/kappa_Pl` is the additional bounded-surface
input used here.  The theorem does not derive the SI decimal Planck scale and
does not derive an action-unit convention from the mass anchor alone.

## Consequence For Y_T

Let the normalized six-component top source direction be

```text
O_top = sum_i u_i O_i,
u_i = 1/sqrt(6),   i = 1,...,6,
sum_i u_i^2 = 1.
```

If the physical top source deformation is the one-Planck-action unit
deformation along this normalized direction,

```text
S_h = S_0 - kappa_Pl h O_top,
```

then the RN/Fisher source coordinate is unit normalized and the top component
is

```text
y_33 = 1/sqrt(6).
```

This is the positive bounded bridge the previous boundary left open.  It replaces the
ambiguous phrase "primitive source unit" by a precise same-surface statement:
the primitive source unit is one Planck action quantum multiplying the
unit-Fisher normalized signed source direction.

## Remaining Hinge

This note does not prove that the physical top Yukawa deformation is the
one-Planck-action unit deformation along `O_top`.  It proves that if the top
source is that deformation, then the Planck/action coordinate and RN/Fisher
coordinate coincide and `lambda = 1`.

The remaining row-level audit question is therefore narrower than before:

```text
Is the physical top source the one-Planck-action unit deformation along the
normalized democratic signed-linear top source direction?
```

If yes, this bridge and the existing Y_T source-support packet would close the
scalar `lambda` blocker on the Tier-A Planck/action surface.  If no, the
strict same-source top/W response route remains necessary.

## Non-Claims

This note does not claim full Y_T closure.  It does not derive the
Planck scale from the two axioms, does not derive SI `hbar`, does not repair
the old Ward chain, and does not use `H_unit`, `yt_ward_identity`, `y_t_bare`,
PDG targets, `alpha_LM`, plaquette/u0, or fitted selectors.
