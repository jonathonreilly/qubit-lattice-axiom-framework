# Author Pre-Flight — run before requesting review

Purpose: drain every mechanically-checkable and source-verifiable defect from
a change BEFORE an adversarial reviewer sees it, so review rounds converge in
one or two passes and reviewer effort goes to deep findings. This checklist
was distilled from the 2026-07-16/17 front-door campaign, where multi-round
reviews repeatedly caught the same defect classes. It is an authoring
discipline, not a gate: the review loop and the independent audit lane remain
the only authorities, and a clean pre-flight grants a change no standing.

Reviewers may cite a skipped pre-flight item as a finding when the defect it
would have caught is present.

## Validation placement

Use the coherent-unit and validation-placement contract in `SKILL.md`.
Run focused source, runner, premise, vocabulary, and diff checks for each unit.
References below to a full pipeline, strict lint, graph/queue inspection, and
changed-evidence validation refer to one shared pass on the exact integrated
current-main candidate, not a separate full run per constituent or unit.
Reuse an identical successful base/tree receipt only with the skill's complete
input/tool/evidence provenance; record pending integration validation honestly.
These checks confer no scientific verdict or independent reviewer PASS.
Use `scripts/review_receipt.py` with `references/UNIT_RECEIPT.md` to share one
versioned source/input/report record and check actual publication, citation,
canonical-ID and helper/input discovery before final execution. Add its cache
check after freezing final evidence; preserve earlier receipts after any change.
For exact historical storage, exclusive sequential checkout reuse and freshly
fetched child heads, load only the needed section of `references/OPERATIONS.md`.
These helpers do not replace independent review or the combined landing gate.
For authorized early repair handoffs, use the skill's overlap-repairs guidance:
the original review continues on immutable source, and provisional findings do
not certify the final unit. Check actual publication discovery, citations and
input bindings before final runner execution; freeze the reconciled correction
and inputs first. Preserve prior receipts if a later input change requires a
new authorized execution.

Use the owner-selected focused landing depth in `SKILL.md`: default Astra-low
review, targeted escalation for material unresolved questions, and concise
reusable evidence. Fix consequential defects before handoff; do not construct
new per-sentence, per-function or per-array report catalogs without a concrete
source-preservation or scientific need. This preflight is not formal audit.

## 1. Sources, not memory

Every sentence that characterizes a claim, a note, or a status is written
with the source open — the note's own claim/boundary section, the ledger
shard, or the registered policy doc — and asserts nothing stronger than the
source's own wording. Session memory, PR titles, and campaign shorthand name
targets; they are never quotable claim text. If you did not just read it, do
not write it.

## 2. Numbers and dates

Every count, total, or date you quote is recomputed at your current HEAD from
its authority (ledger shards, `effective_status_summary.json`, generated
views) and carries an as-of qualifier when the value moves with the nightly.
Volatile numbers in durable prose need either a companion runner that
genuinely re-derives them from their authority (not one that re-states the
quoted values) or a dated stamp naming the ledger state they quote. One
document must not carry two incompatible as-of dates.

## 3. Status words

Grep your diff for grade vocabulary (`retained`, `retained_bounded`,
`retained_no_go`, `promoted`, `ratified`, `audited_*`). Every hit is either
(a) verified against the row's shard at HEAD, (b) status-neutral wording, or
(c) inside a dated historical/changelog line. Author surfaces never pre-state
a verdict; a new source-note `Status` line carries exactly
`proposed_retained` or `proposed_promoted`, and any other status wording
must come from the applicable family in the controlled vocabulary (see
item 4) — one family per column or field, never a hybrid phrase.

## 4. Vocabulary

List every noun phrase your change introduces to categorize claims, lanes, or
tiers. Each must already exist in
[`docs/repo/CONTROLLED_VOCABULARY.md`](../../../repo/CONTROLLED_VOCABULARY.md)
or be plain descriptive prose. Coining a tier or class word ("review-gated",
"established", a campaign name) is a defect even when the concept is real —
say the process fact instead ("landed through review, not yet audited"), or,
when no mechanical rewrite exists, defer it explicitly through the review
loop's vocabulary path (`prose_status: needs_human_vocab_decision` /
`docs/repo/ACTIVE_REVIEW_QUEUE.md`); never land it silently.

## 5. Links

Every markdown link in your diff dereferences to one git-tracked regular
file or a web URL (the invariants harness enforces this on authority surfaces:
`directory-target`, `not-tracked`, `absolute-path`, `outside-repository`
are all violations). Load-bearing dependencies are markdown links — backticks
seed no citation-graph edges; decorative references are backticks — links
seed edges you must intend.

## 6. Graph topology

Before the shared full validation pass, inspect the intended topology changes
against the reviewed source. Use the skill's `--stage-citation-manifest` full-run
option so stage 1b's generated acknowledgment reaches the index before stage 18;
no separate pre-pipeline graph build or per-unit full run is needed.
During that shared pass, if the citation-graph delta gate
(stage 18 vs the tracked manifest, stage 1b) names nodes your change adds, removes, or rewires
(rewiring surfaces as a changed node; read your source diff and the manifest
diff for the edge identities): confirm each is intended, then acknowledge by
staging the refreshed `docs/audit/data/citation_graph_manifest.json`. Generated status surfaces and
class-F orientation memos under `docs/repo/` must contribute no edges at all
(they are excluded in `build_citation_graph.py`; extend the exclusion when
you add such a surface).

## 7. Generated-but-tracked files

If your change ships a tracked generated file (initial materialization or a
renderer change), regenerate it from the TRACKED input state as the last step
before committing — never from post-seed local pipeline state, which can
embed status changes your tree's shards do not carry. Register nightly
ownership (`codex_audit_runner.AUDIT_DATA_FILES`) and the graph exclusion
where applicable.

## 8. Runners

Every new or changed runner check is mutation-checked: one load-bearing
mutation per check family (on a scratch copy or reverted immediately), and
the check must fail. A check that asserts the formula it is supposed to test
confirms nothing. Record the mutations you ran in the PR body.

In that same combined pass, after the full pipeline refreshes changed-runner
caches, run
`python3 docs/audit/scripts/check_changed_audit_evidence.py --base
origin/main --include-worktree`. This includes staged, unstaged, and untracked
author changes before committing. Fix every named missing runner/input/current
compute result or incomplete N5 certificate before landing; report pending
combined validation when requesting review after focused source checks. This is preflight only:
the independent audit reruns the exact runner live and does not inherit a PR
author's verdict.

## 9. Clean-state validation

Identify generated residue separately from source and recovery artifacts;
never blanket-clean a data directory. Run `python3 scripts/vocab_lint.py --fix`
on changed files. Satisfy the full pipeline, strict lint, and changed-evidence
checks in the shared combined pass above (warnings and notices may remain;
errors block landing). Then restore
generated outputs, stage explicit paths only, and confirm `git status` shows
exactly your intended files.

## 10. Read your own diff as the reviewer

Read the complete diff once, cold, before requesting review — not the files,
the diff. Every hunk you cannot justify in one sentence from a source you
just read is a hunk the reviewer will bounce.
