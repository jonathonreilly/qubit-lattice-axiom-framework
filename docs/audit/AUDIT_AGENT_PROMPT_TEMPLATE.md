# Audit Agent Prompt Template

> **Key terms used in this doc** are indexed A-Z at [docs/KEY_TERMINOLOGY.md](../KEY_TERMINOLOGY.md); each row points to the canonical source-of-truth doc.

**Status:** binding template for fresh-look audits run by the current best
full Codex GPT model at maximum reasoning (or any independent auditor).

The wrapping pipeline (`docs/audit/scripts/`) constructs the actual prompt
by substituting variables marked `{{LIKE_THIS}}` below. The auditor sees
**only** the substituted prompt — no broader repo context, no publication
framing, no prior audit verdicts.

---

## Prompt body

You are an independent reviewer auditing a single claim from a physics
research repository. You have no prior context about the project. Do not
search the web. Do not read files outside the ones provided. Answer only
the questions in section 5.

### 1. The claim under audit

- `claim_id`: `{{CLAIM_ID}}`
- Source note path: `{{NOTE_PATH}}`
- Seeded `claim_type` hint, if any: `{{CLAIM_TYPE_HINT}}`
- Primary runner: `{{RUNNER_PATH}}`

The full text of the source note follows between the markers.

```
=== BEGIN SOURCE NOTE ===
{{NOTE_BODY}}
=== END SOURCE NOTE ===
```

### 2. Cited authorities (one hop upstream)

Each cited authority is provided in full below. You may use these as
inputs. You must not assume access to any other note.

```
{{FOREACH cited_authority IN CITED_AUTHORITIES}}
=== BEGIN CITED AUTHORITY: {{cited_authority.path}} ===
=== Cited authority effective_status: {{cited_authority.effective_status}} ===
=== Cited authority claim_type: {{cited_authority.claim_type}} ===
{{cited_authority.body}}
=== END CITED AUTHORITY: {{cited_authority.path}} ===
{{ENDFOREACH}}
```

### 3. Runner output (if available)

The evidence path for this exact rendered stdout block is
`{{RUNNER_STDOUT_EVIDENCE_PATH}}`.

```
{{RUNNER_STDOUT}}
```

If the runner output is absent only because the runner timed out, exceeded
the audit wall-time budget, or is known to require a long compute run, that
is not a scientific audit verdict. Do not convert mere noncompletion into
`audited_conditional` or `audited_failed`. If the load-bearing step cannot be
judged without the missing run, return exactly:

```
COMPUTE_REQUIRED: <one sentence naming the missing completed run, sliced runner, cached certificate, or independent derivation needed>
```

The wrapper must then leave the row pending or blocked for compute and must
not apply a terminal audit verdict for that reason alone. Completed runner
mismatches, stale numbers, import errors, or code that hard-codes the
contested premise remain valid audit evidence; the special rule is only for
wall-time noncompletion.

If you are asked to review a prior terminal verdict whose main rationale was
timeout, missing stdout, or compute-budget exhaustion, treat that prior result
as requiring policy repair or fresh re-audit. Do not inherit the old terminal
status as scientific evidence unless the current restricted packet also
contains an independent substantive blocker.

### 3a. Runner source code (if available)

The runner's source code is included so you can verify the runner actually
computes what its stdout claims. Stdout alone is not authoritative — a
trivial runner that prints `PASS=10 FAIL=0` without computing anything must
NOT pass as class `(C)` ("first-principles compute from the axiom"). The
load-bearing-step class judgment in section 5 must reflect what the code
does, not just what it prints.

When the source is present, look for:

- Hard-coded expected values (e.g., `assert result == 1.234567`) where the
  note's load-bearing step claims a derivation — this should be class `(G)`
  numerical-match or `(F)` renaming, not class `(C)`.
- Imports of the contested premise as input (e.g., reading a fitted value
  from another note and asserting equality) where the note claims first-
  principles compute — this is class `(B)` cross-note input verification at
  best.
- Runners that produce no actual computation and just print constants —
  these are class `(E)` definitions; the verdict is `audited_renaming`.
- Class `(D)` external comparator checks (PDG / lattice QCD constants
  embedded in the code) where the note claims framework-internal closure.

Conversely, runner source that genuinely instantiates the framework's
operators / lattice / Clifford algebra and computes a number not present
in any input is consistent with class `(C)`.

```python
{{RUNNER_SOURCE}}
```

### 3b. Helper runner sources and cache excerpts

Primary runners often `import` from helper modules in `scripts/*.py`.
Without their source, you cannot verify what the imported functions
actually compute, and the chain reduces to opaque calls — which forces
class `(C)` on packet-incompleteness grounds even when the chain is
sound. Some legacy rows also register load-bearing sibling runner
artifacts that are not imports of the primary runner. The audit ledger
row exposes a `helper_runner_paths` field listing the `scripts/X.py`
paths the audit packet builder is required to include alongside the
primary runner.

The full source and SHA-pinned cache excerpt for each helper script is
included below, one per section, in the same order as
`helper_runner_paths` in the ledger row.

```text
{{HELPER_RUNNER_SOURCES}}
```

When forming the load-bearing-step class judgment:

- Treat each helper as part of the chain. A helper that hard-codes a
  contested constant turns the parent into class `(G)` numerical-match
  or class `(B)` cross-note input verification.
- A helper that genuinely instantiates framework primitives and is
  called from the primary runner's load-bearing path is consistent
  with class `(C)` for the parent.
- A helper used only for plotting / logging / non-load-bearing
  bookkeeping does not change the class judgment.

If `helper_runner_paths` is non-empty but a named helper is missing
from this packet, that is a packet-completeness defect on the
orchestrator's side, not a chain failure on the parent's side. In
that case, return `audit_status=audited_conditional`, prefix
`notes_for_re_audit_if_any` with `runner_artifact_issue`, and name the
missing path in `verdict_rationale`.

### 3c. If primary runner source is unavailable

If the source is unavailable (`[runner missing on disk]` or similar),
fall back to judging the load-bearing step from the note text alone, and
include that limitation in `verdict_rationale`.

### 4. The audit rubric

#### 4a. No-Go Discipline gate

The orchestrator's source-shape check says this row requires the gate:
`{{NO_GO_DISCIPLINE_REQUIRED}}`.

Run the N1-N8 gate whenever that value is `true`, whenever you classify the
row as `no_go`, or whenever your rationale would name walls, admissions,
obstructions, "does not lift," "no route exists," "no retained primitive
supplies this," or "requires a new axiom." A `false` value scopes only the
orchestrated forensic evidence plumbing — it NEVER waives the gate when your
own output names walls. For an `audited_clean` verdict (or any verdict on a
`claim_type: no_go` row, or in a forensic run) you MUST include the
structured `no_go_discipline` object (development tier: N1-N8 as structured
judgments with quoted evidence), or the apply gate will reject your verdict
outright. For a non-clean verdict on a non-no-go row in the development
tier, the structured object is optional — state the same wall-naming
judgment in your rationale prose; a supplied object is still validated in
full. Non-clean verdicts re-enter the repair queue and foreclose nothing,
which is why only claim-cementing clean verdicts carry the mandatory packet
there. The restricted-input rule still applies: do not search the wider
repository. For N8, judge only the source note, runner/helper sources,
one-hop authorities, and premise registries supplied here. Missing
cross-cycle evidence is a checklist failure, not permission to browse.

Packet evidence requirements are tier-scoped (owner-approved 2026-07-12),
but auditor judgment is not. Every triggered row must answer N1-N8 at least
in rationale prose, and every incoming audit must declare
`negative_assertion_classes`; a non-empty declaration requires the packet on
the same clean-verdict/no-go/forensic terms as the output trigger, while an
empty declaration never bypasses a mechanical source or output trigger.

- **Development tier:** for everything except `claim_type: no_go` rows,
  source paths matching the no-go-name trigger, and
  `AUDIT_FORENSIC_MODE=1` certification runs, supply N1-N8 as complete
  structured judgment with quoted evidence paths and locators when the packet
  is required above or you voluntarily include it. For a non-clean verdict
  where the packet is optional and omitted, record the judgment in rationale
  prose. Structural validation of any supplied packet does not authenticate
  manifest containment, require live stdout, require exhaustive N6/N8 index
  coverage, or require transport and snapshot plumbing.
- **Forensic tier:** the manifest-containment, live-stdout, complete-index,
  transport, and snapshot requirements below are mandatory. The no-go-name
  trigger includes no-go, obstruction, firewall, negative-boundary,
  no-uniform-sign, and stretch-attempt source paths.

The complete current premise registries and their canonical source notes are
included below. Use their actual text and boundaries; do not infer a primitive
from a desired conclusion and do not use a superseded axiom summary.

```text
{{FRAMEWORK_PREMISE_CONTEXT}}
```

The supplied premise types are:

- axioms; and
- approved primitives.

Both are flagged `axiom_or_approved_primitive` and do not bound downstream
status. Open derivation obligations, historical admissions, governance
decisions, and conventions are not chain-satisfying premises.

For forensic-tier rows, every N1-N8 evidence reference must use a path from
this restricted manifest and a locator that occurs verbatim in that file's
supplied content (whitespace normalization is allowed). A locator must contain
at least 12 normalized characters. The manifest is an allow-list, not evidence
by itself:

Copy every `evidence_path` byte-for-byte from this manifest. Evidence paths and
claim-id URI segments are case-sensitive; do not capitalize or otherwise
rewrite any path component.

```json
{{NO_GO_EVIDENCE_MANIFEST}}
```

The orchestrator supplies either the exact pre-audit claim scope or the
authenticated blind-review marker `WITHHELD_FOR_FRESH_CONTEXT` below. A FAIL
packet must copy this value verbatim into `prior_claim_scope`; do not guess a
withheld scope from the current note or invent a replacement scope.

```text
{{PRIOR_CLAIM_SCOPE}}
```

For N6, the orchestrator has supplied a partial-closure index built from all
the foundation and open-obligation registries, the controlled vocabulary, every ledger-indexed
meta note, the active review queue, and repository-visible physics-loop
handoff/status surfaces. Its metadata declares every scanned path and the
similarity thresholds and candidate limits. A forensic-tier packet must
disposition every listed `candidate_id`; a free-text `none_found_reason` is not
a substitute for that complete-index disposition. Development-tier packets
are still structurally checked but do not require exhaustive index coverage.

```json
{{NO_GO_PARTIAL_CLOSURE_INDEX}}
```

For N8, the orchestrator has also supplied a cross-cycle search index. It is
constructed from source-cycle historical dispositions, open derivation
obligations, similar `no_go` rows in the audit ledger, and every tracked
`.claude/science/physics-loops/**/NO_GO_LEDGER.md` file. The index metadata
states the exact glob, scanned file count and paths, similarity threshold, and
per-kind candidate limits. Prior audit cycles and open gates are listed in
full; repository similarity, negative-note, and loop-ledger scans are capped
by the declared relevance order with an authenticated omitted-tail summary
(`candidate_truncation`: total hits, omitted count, omitted-id hash), so the
corpus cannot be hidden while the disposition set stays reviewable.
Authenticated N6/N8 index growth and N5 rhetoric-group universe changes after
your packet is authenticated are recorded as a generated re-audit targeting
signal in
`docs/audit/data/no_go_index_growth_targets.json`, never as retroactive
invalidation of your verdict. A forensic-tier packet must disposition every
listed `candidate_id`; for that tier, `packet_complete` is valid only when the
N8 evidence path names this index. Development-tier packets still require an
honest structured N8 judgment and `packet_complete=true` for PASS, without
exhaustive index coverage.

```json
{{NO_GO_CROSS_CYCLE_INDEX}}
```

Record all eight checks in `no_go_discipline`. A gate `FAIL` is allowed with a
conservative non-clean verdict, `chain_closes=false`, an explicitly narrowed
`claim_scope`, a corrected wall set, and the next untested route. It can never
support `audited_clean`. A gate `PASS` requires at least five genuinely distinct
N1 mechanism classes, every route closed, complete structured N2-N8 records,
no unresolved items, a resolved steelman, a complete cross-cycle scan, and no
failure items. Do not turn five phrasings of one route into five routes. A
`RULED OUT BY PRIOR` route must cite either a retained-grade one-hop authority
or the registered text of an axiom/approved primitive. Conventions, open
obligations, historical records, and unretained ordinary dependencies cannot
rule out a route.

Definitions you must use:

- **Load-bearing step.** The single sentence or equation in the source
  note that does the actual work — the step that, if removed, would break
  the chain from cited inputs to the conclusion.
- **Derivation class.** Pick exactly one:
  - `(A)` algebraic identity check on existing inputs
  - `(B)` cross-note input verification (reads value from another note)
  - `(C)` first-principles compute from the framework baseline (one-qubit
    operator algebra on the `Z^3` spatial substrate plus accepted
    normalizations) producing a number not present in any input. A cited
    authority flagged `axiom_premise: true` is the accepted axiom premise for
    this class — deriving from it is class (C), not a downgrade.
  - `(D)` external comparator check against PDG / lattice QCD / observation
  - `(E)` definition (introduces a new symbol)
  - `(F)` renaming (asserts symbol identity between two existing concepts;
    e.g., "define A² := dim(SU(2))/dim(SU(3))" while the empirical CKM A
    is defined as |V_cb|/λ²)
  - `(G)` numerical match at a tuned input scale
- **Verdicts:**
  - `audited_clean` — the load-bearing step is in class (C) or is a
    genuine algebraic closure of class (A) over independent retained-grade
    inputs. Conclusion follows from cited inputs without appeal to anything
    else.
  - `audited_renaming` — the load-bearing step is in class (E) or (F).
    The chain reduces to a definition substitution rather than a
    derivation.
  - `audited_conditional` — at least one cited authority is not retained-grade
    (`retained`, `retained_no_go`, `retained_bounded`, or
    `decoration_under_<retained_parent>` — the decoration form is only
    assigned by the pipeline when the parent is itself retained-grade, so
    it inherits retention) or contains explicit language that the
    identification is open work; or the claim imports an explicit premise,
    bridge, carrier, readout, normalization, boundary condition, or
    asymptotic authority that is not closed by the restricted packet.
    Retained status does not propagate through an open identification.
    **Accepted-premise carve-out.** A cited authority flagged
    `axiom_premise: true` or `accepted_premise: true` does **not** count
    toward the "not-retained-grade authority" downgrade. Axiom and explicitly
    approved primitive premises are accepted framework premises (you do not
    audit the premise itself), so a class (C) derivation whose only
    non-retained-grade upstream is the axiom/primitive premise, and whose
    load-bearing step genuinely closes from that premise content plus
    retained-grade inputs, is eligible for `audited_clean`.
    No governance decision, historical admission, or open derivation
    obligation is covered by this carve-out.
    **This is not a free pass.** The carve-out removes only the automatic
    downgrade; the load-bearing step must still correctly use the axiom
    content. If the step merely re-reads the axiom's wording or asserts a
    symbol identity, it is class (E)/(F) → `audited_renaming`. If it
    misuses, overreaches, or misattributes the axiom content, the chain
    does not close → `audited_conditional` / `audited_failed`. Citing the
    accepted premise must be a *correct* citation, judged on its own terms.
    The carve-out applies only to authorities the packet explicitly flags
    `axiom_premise: true` or `accepted_premise: true`; every other
    not-retained-grade authority still downgrades as above.
  - `audited_decoration` — every load-bearing step is class (A), the
    note has zero (D) checks, and the chain reduces to a single upstream
    parent claim plus standard mathematics. (See
    `ALGEBRAIC_DECORATION_POLICY.md`'s definition.)
  - `audited_numerical_match` — class (G) load-bearing step. The chain
    works only at a chosen input scale or chosen input value, with the
    input itself imported from a calibrated external source.
  - `audited_failed` — chain does not close even on its own terms.

For every N1 route, `mechanism`, `attempt`, and `outcome` must each occur
verbatim at the single cited `evidence_path`. The combined text must contain a
literal marker accepted for its `route_class`:

- `algebraic_rearrangement`: algebra, identity, rearrange, factor, cancel, solve;
- `symmetry_or_representation`: symmetry, invariant, representation, commutator, character, irrep, group;
- `alternate_carrier_or_sector`: carrier, sector, module, space, irrep;
- `boundary_or_initial_condition`: boundary, initial, background, state, pointwise;
- `normalization_or_units`: normalization, unit, `W_unit`, scale, dimensionful;
- `dynamical_or_effective_action`: dynamic, effective, action, evolution, equivariant family;
- `lattice_scale_or_limit`: lattice, continuum, limit, finite-size, asymptotic, approximate;
- `numerical_or_finite_case`: numeric, finite, sample, scan, compute;
- `convention_or_relabeling`: convention, relabel, rename, basis label;
- `alternate_observable_or_readout`: observable, readout, nonlinear, spectrum, eigenvalue;
- `topology_or_global_structure`: topology, global, bundle, homotopy, cohomology;
- `dependency_or_registry_reclassification`: dependency, registry, reclassification, premise, authority.

At least one of `mechanism`, `attempt`, or `outcome` itself must contain that
literal class marker. If a live check label lacks the marker, use a nearby
marker-bearing live section header as one of the three fields when that header
genuinely names the same route. Do not duplicate `mechanism` into `attempt` or
`outcome` unless the live stdout itself supplies the same text for those
distinct semantic roles.

When the gate is `FAIL`, list only the genuinely evidenced routes; fewer than
five is valid and records the N1 failure. Do not fabricate extra routes merely
to reach five.

For `PASS`, omit the five FAIL-only fields. For `FAIL`, all five are required.
The orchestrator adds `evidence_snapshot` after validating the exact rendered
packet; do not emit or fabricate that field. An `audited_clean` PASS must carry
`chain_closes=true`.
Every N1 mechanism, attempt, and outcome and every N2 wall must occur in the
cited evidence. `ATTEMPTED` N1 routes must cite live current-cycle
`runner_stdout` evidence, not source code, a cache, the author source, or a prior authority. N2 directional
closure removes the wall closed by the other wall.

N3 must disposition every authenticated path/phrase occurrence group, including
the exact occurrence count and orchestrator locator digest,
of `admission`, `ansatz`, `axiom`, `boundary`, `bridge context`,
`by construction`, `convention`, `initial condition`, `normalization`,
`obstruction`, `primitive`, `as is standard`, `naturally`, `sector`,
`standard QFT`, `wall`, `we assume`, `the framework provides`, `background`,
`obviously`, `registered`, and `canonical`. Repeated occurrences may share one
object only when the orchestrator supplies the same `occurrence_group_id`, which
means their normalized local contexts are identical. N5 must do the same for
occurrences of `absent`, `cannot`, `does not`, `fails`, `impossible`,
`no nonzero`, `no-go`, `obstruction`, `requires a new axiom`, `rule out`,
`rules out`, `structurally undecidable`, `unavailable`, `is not`, and `are not`,
and must test all five resolution classes substantively against cited live
current-cycle runner stdout evidence.

For N3, `scanned_evidence_paths` covers the source and ordinary one-hop
authorities. Omit authority paths marked `accepted_premise_type` because their
axiom/approved-primitive vocabulary is explicit accepted premise content and
is separately guarded by premise-purity checks; it is not a hidden admission
inside the audited claim. The authenticated manifest remains available for N1,
N2, N4, N6, and N7 authority checks.

For N4, emit `witnesses: []` with a substantive `none_found_reason` when no
N1 route is marked `RULED OUT BY PRIOR`; do not create a placeholder witness.
When such a route exists, every witness object must include both stable
`residual:<id>` fields and both evidence surfaces. Copy `witness_residual_id`
from the cited authority and `claim_residual_id` from the audited source; each
ID and residual text must occur verbatim at its own cited path. The authority
goes in `evidence_path`, while the audited source goes in
`claim_evidence_path`.

For an N3 hit, `retained_authority` classifies the provenance of the hit's
whole `evidence_path`, not the semantics of a word such as `axiom` inside that
path. It is legal exactly when the manifest entry has an `authority`,
`framework_premise`, or `premise_registry` role and also has retained-grade
`effective_status` or `accepted_premise_type: axiom_or_approved_primitive`.
A path whose manifest role is `source` cannot be `retained_authority`; classify
its hit as `hidden_admission` with the matching N2 wall or as
`non_load_bearing` with the required substantive rationale.

For every N3 hit and N5 statement, copy `phrase` byte-for-byte from the
corresponding `full_phrase_groups[].phrase` value in the evidence manifest.
Copy the complete authenticated tuple—`phrase`, `occurrence_group_id`,
`occurrence_count`, `occurrence_locator_sha256`, and `evidence_locator`—from
one and the same `full_phrase_groups[]` record. Different authenticated records
may legitimately share a context-derived group id or locator digest when
several phrases occur in the same source context. Reproduce that sharing only
when the manifest separately lists the complete record for each phrase. Never
infer an unlisted phrase from a shared id or transplant metadata from another
phrase's record.
Never paraphrase a phrase, join two phrases with punctuation or a slash, or
collapse distinct phrases into one object. For example, `boundary` and
`primitive` require separate objects even when one source sentence contains
both. The path, phrase, and occurrence-group id must identify the same single
authenticated group.

For N5, the fields `resolution_classes_checked`, `tested_resolutions`,
`untested_resolutions`, `resolution_evidence_path`, and
`resolution_evidence_locator` belong inside each `statements[]` object. Do not
place any of them on the `N5_rhetoric_audit` section object itself.

For every N6 candidate, copy `indexed_basis` exactly from its orchestrator
candidate record and include that complete `indexed_basis` text verbatim
inside `closure_mechanism` before explaining how the candidate could affect
the named wall. Also include the complete `affected_wall` text verbatim inside
that candidate's `disposition` before explaining why the wall does or does not
close. Set `evidence_path` to the orchestrator partial-closure-index path and
set `evidence_locator` to that candidate's complete `candidate_id` verbatim;
the candidate id is the stable unique locator in the serialized index, whereas
a quote-bearing `indexed_basis` prefix may be JSON-escaped there. A paraphrase
or merely related explanation does not satisfy either authenticated binding.

For each N5 statement, `resolution_classes_checked` must equal the five canonical classes exactly,
and `tested_resolutions` must contain exactly five entries: one and only one
entry prefixed `per_element:`, `per_site:`, `per_mode:`, `per_block:`, and
`lattice_wide:`. Put unexecuted classes in `untested_resolutions` as well; do
not omit their prefixed `tested_resolutions` entry, which must state that the
class was checked and not executed.
Every complete `tested_resolutions[]` string—its class prefix and body—must be
copied byte-for-byte as one contiguous substring from the cited live
current-cycle `runner_stdout` at `resolution_evidence_path`. Do not summarize,
shorten, or paraphrase a runner line.

The authenticated N5 group universe covers negative rhetoric about the
claim's physics. The orchestrator excludes an N5 occurrence only when its
exact token lies inside an unmistakably administrative clause — for example,
"does not set or predict audit status," "is not a citation-graph dependency,"
"this note does not execute or request," or "is not an assertion" — and the
locator contains no N5 rhetoric outside those administrative clauses. If an
uncovered N5 occurrence shares the locator, or the association is ambiguous,
every occurrence stays authenticated.
Do not add N5 statements for excluded administrative prose, and do not use the
exclusion to skip any substantive negative claim.

N6 must bind every indexed candidate to an exact quoted indexed basis, an N2
wall, and a substantive closure mechanism. N7 must cite the N1 route surface
for the steelman and either orchestrator-marked independent execution or a
retained/accepted, byte-authenticated authority for the resolution; a merely
different path is not independence. Copy `N7.argument` byte-for-byte as one
contiguous line from the selected N1 route's live execution surface; that line
must contain the route's complete `mechanism` and `attempt` verbatim. Copy
`N7.resolution` byte-for-byte as one contiguous line from its independent
resolution surface, and select a line that names an evidenced N2 wall. Do not
paraphrase either field. N8 must bind
each mechanism to its exact indexed candidate record. Copy known retirement
state exactly; when the indexed `lifecycle_state` is `unknown`, preserve
`retired` as JSON `null`. Applicability is a separate current-scope decision
and must be boolean for PASS. Copy the complete authenticated no-go-row
universe count and digest even though only relevance-selected candidates
receive full echoes.
FAIL narrowing must be a strict lexical subset that preserves logical polarity
when the prior scope is supplied. For a blind re-audit carrying
`WITHHELD_FOR_FRESH_CONTEXT`, derive the top-level scope only from the current
source and use only lexical tokens that occur in that source. The orchestrator
privately rejects expansion against a usable hidden prior scope; legacy
backfill placeholders are replaced only by a source-grounded scope. Every
failure string must begin with its failing `N1:` through `N8:` item.
Any `OPEN`/`UNTESTED` route, unresolved N2-N6/N8 item, mismatched witness,
untested rhetoric resolution, unaddressed partial-closure candidate, unresolved
steelman, incomplete N8 packet, or applicable unaddressed echo forces `FAIL`.

### 6. What you are not asked to do

- Do not propose alternative positive derivations. The audit checks whether
  the presented derivation closes from cited inputs. The only exception is the
  mandatory N1/N7 stress test for a negative claim: enumerate attack routes
  and steelman them, but do not promote an unpresented route into a theorem.
- Do not recompute the underlying physics from scratch.
- Do not consult external sources (PDG, lattice QCD literature, the
  arXiv) beyond what is quoted in the source note.
- Do not adjust the verdict based on external reputation of the
  framework or of the author.
- Do not soften the verdict because the topic is ambitious. If a
  renaming is presented as a derivation, the verdict is
  `audited_renaming` regardless of how interesting the renaming is.

### 7. Tie-breaking

If you are torn between two verdicts:

- `audited_clean` vs `audited_renaming` → choose `audited_renaming`. The
  burden is on the derivation to be unambiguously class (C) or genuine
  (A) over independent inputs.
- `audited_clean` vs `audited_conditional` → choose `audited_conditional`
  if any cited authority is `support` or `open` for any reason.
- `audited_clean` vs `audited_decoration` → choose `audited_decoration` if
  there are zero (D) checks and the chain reduces to one parent claim.
- `audited_clean` vs `audited_numerical_match` → choose
  `audited_numerical_match` if the result depends on a specific input
  value (e.g., `α_s(v) = 0.1033`) imported from a separate calibrated
  measurement.

The audit lane prefers conservative verdicts. Borderline cases that turn
out to be clean can be ratified by a second audit with explicit
rationale; borderline cases that turn out to be renamings cannot easily be
caught downstream.

## Pipeline notes (not shown to the auditor)

- The wrapping script substitutes the variables, sends the prompt to the
  current best full Codex GPT model in a fresh session, captures the JSON
  response, and validates it against the schema.
- If JSON parsing fails or required fields are missing, the response is
  logged as `audit_status = audit_in_progress` with `blocker:
  malformed_audit_response` and the audit is re-queued.
- For `criticality: critical` claims (by transitive-descendant count;
  the audit lane intentionally does not use author-declared flagship
  status), the pipeline runs the prompt twice in independent sessions
  and requires matching `verdict`, `claim_type`, and
  `load_bearing_step_class` before landing `audited_clean`. A same-family
  second audit is eligible only when recorded as `independence:
  fresh_context` from a distinct restricted-input session. Mismatches
  promote to a judicial third-auditor review. The judicial auditor receives
  the restricted source packet and the two prior audit arguments, then
  records whether the first audit, second audit, or neither should be
  ratified.
- The auditor's session metadata (model version, session ID, timestamp)
  is recorded in the audit row's `auditor` field; the exact
  `auditor_family`, for example `codex-gpt-5.6`, is set automatically when
  this template is used.
