## Result

A first conditional interface from the Cycle-703 local-Gauss matter code to
the landed Cycle-610/612 predecessor and causal-order code closes exactly.

For an exact dressed matter FSWAP on an oriented two-cell bond, define the
candidate endpoint opportunity

```text
P_B(before,after) = OR_a [B_a(before) != B_a(after)].
```

On the tested seam factor only the two transported matter endpoints can
change.  Since `B_a=(-1)^{n_a}` on the declared occupation basis,
`P_B=n_u xor n_v`.  The runner executes all 4,096 two-cell matter columns for
all 36 directed port pairs:

- 73,728 changing columns have `P_B=1`;
- 73,728 nonchanging columns have `P_B=0`;
- predicate, B-pointer, matter-delta, local-D, and reference-update failures
  are all zero;
- diagonal contact gives zero false endpoints;
- all 24 proper-cubic frames preserve the port family without an exterior
  ordering table.

The predicate is computed by a seven-qubit reversible XOR/Toffoli comparator.
Its complete 128-row truth table has zero inverse failures.  The two BKSF
endpoint `B` words occupy at most 11 graph-edge qubits across two owner cells;
a single `B` word has weight at most 6.  No update ordinal or schedule position
is read or stored.  These graph-edge qubits have not been composed with the
Cycle-232 `Z^3` physical-site placement/repetition isometry.

This is a candidate opportunity predicate, not an occurrence law.

## Closed interface equations

Let `A_packet` be the reversible software-model append, `Pi_610` forget its
extra payload and retain the landed Cycle-610 `EventCell`, and `D` denote the
interval decoder.  On the declared lawful software domain with explicit
supplied values, the runner executes

```text
Pi_610 A_packet(P_B, supplied_tokens) = A_610 Pi_610
D_packet = D_610 Pi_610
J_612 Pi_610(packet identities) preserves JointOrder admission/refusal.
```

The first equation is checked after every one of 25 append attempts against
the unchanged landed `EventChain.admit`.  Statuses match exactly: 24 admitted,
then bank exhaustion.  Refill, no-opportunity, duplicate-freshness, and
missing-actuality controls also match exactly.

The second equation is checked on forward and reverse intervals:

```text
D(A,B)=9, D(B,C)=12, D(A,C)=21,
D(A,C)=D(A,B)+D(B,C), D(B,A)=-D(A,B).
```

There are zero packet-projection or interval mismatches.

The third equation uses the landed Cycle-612 `JointOrder` class unchanged.
Two matter-qualified sequential co-registrations are admitted and acyclic;
the existing inverted registration is refused; forcing the two inverted
identifications still creates a detected cycle; and a no-B-change control is
not presented to the harness.

## Reversible packet model — software adapter, not an M2 compiler

Each model packet cell stores the following candidate binary fields:

- a 6-bit predecessor address;
- four pre-rotor and four post-rotor bits;
- one carry bit;
- the 12-bit matter delta;
- endpoint, binder, valid, and orientation bits;
- the three supplied actuality/admissibility/law-domain bits.

Total: a candidate 34 payload bits per packet cell, a 6-bit head, and the
declared finite 24-cell model.  These counts are a candidate register
inventory, not executed physical M2 resources.  Address selection, freshness,
conditional writes, head/rotor update, and their uncomputation are implemented
by host Python in this runner.  A bit-level reversible M2 circuit for those
operations remains open.  No asymptotic or minimality claim is made.

Append retains the old head and rotor in the new packet, so unappend is exact
on the last-packet domain.  Six successive appends return exactly to the
initial state under six inverses and replay to the identical forward state.
Additionally, 96 cases spanning every K16 rotor value, both orientations,
and three matter-delta words have zero inverse and carry-truth failures.

The accessible model inverse is positive software-interface evidence and
explicit evidence that this object is **not** a permanent Record.  It is not
evidence of a physical inverse circuit.

## What is executed and what remains physical

Executed on the abstract BKSF edge-qubit surface:

- `B` is the actual local BKSF product of incident graph-edge-qubit Z
  operators;
- the predicate comparator is a bounded reversible binary permutation on
  those graph-edge qubits plus work qubits;
- the underlying dressed seam action is the exact Cycle-703 local-D
  edge-qubit action.

Conditional or supplied:

- the input is already in the local-D occupation-basis code sector;
- blank comparator work M2, model payload values, and a model address selector
  are supplied;
- actuality, admissibility, law-domain, and co-registration ports are
  supplied;
- the K16 rotor convention and cross-order consistency rule are consumed
  from Cycles 610/612;
- predecessor-bank append/unappend, address/freshness selection, interval
  decode, and projection to the landed Cycle-610/612 classes are exact host
  software operations, not an executed M2 circuit.

Open:

- composition with the separate Cycle-703 returned-work open-state E and a
  uniform-support family version of its edge-qubit update;
- composition with an injective proper-cubic `Z^3` physical-site placement,
  stream-edge repetition isometry, and collision-free routed work-qubit
  controller;
- objective occurrence and an autonomous admission law;
- Record permanence;
- an empirical unit or identification of the decoded integer with duration;
- a satisfactory endpoint predicate for diagonal-phase-only contact or
  general superposed coin dynamics;
- a reversible bit-level M2 implementation of the bank, including address,
  freshness, conditional write, head/rotor update, and clean work return.

This runner itself does not execute the later Cycle-703 returned-work
preparation or scaled patch tableau; those are independent companion evidence.
On a superposed input the reversible B comparator produces an entangled
opportunity pointer.  Nothing in this runner selects or actualizes a branch.
The diagonal contact control is intentionally silent because no occupation
`B` changes.  Thus this result does not claim that every physical interaction
produces an endpoint.

## Discipline and novelty boundary

The new physical content is the bounded local-B endpoint predicate.  The
finite reversible software adapter and exact projection equations test the
interface contract only.  The predecessor arithmetic, K16 carry convention,
admission token types, and causal-order refusal rule are landed Cycle-610/612
content and are not presented as new.

No count word, packet ordinal, or rotor value is called time.  No packet is
called a Record.  No occurrence, permanence, empirical calibration, Born
meaning, or state-preparation result is inferred from this bridge.  No no-go,
minimum-content, or axiom-pressure claim is made; diagonal and superposed
endpoints remain live constructive work.
