# Full-`Z^3` Causal-Front Sampled-Instrument Law

**Date:** 2026-07-14

**Type:** meta

**Scope:** explicit bare-metal law construction and adversarial variant probe

**Authority:** none. This is a conditional candidate-law witness, not the
physical law, an axiom proposal, an audit verdict, or a retained theorem. It
changes no axiom, registry, or audit surface. Its negative result is a narrow
no-go confined to the tested autonomous one-qubit status and bounded-renewal
routes.

## Result In Plain Language

There is a genuinely small full-lattice rule that closes most of the missing
record-process interfaces at once. It is useful because it is an actual law
value, not another list of boxes a future law should fill.

Start with finitely many records in one boundary-supplied unordered orthogonal
qubit frame. Every open site touching a record is on the next causal front.
The labels it may write are exactly the labels present on its recorded
neighbors. Give each occurrence one ticket. At the next front step, every
ready site samples one label from those tickets and becomes a permanent
site-addressed record. Repeat on the new outer front.

This one rule derives:

- local event readiness and a causal layer order;
- neighbor-dependent availability;
- an exact normalized qubit CP instrument and one-shot statistics;
- append-only record identity and nonreconnection;
- commuting composition on disjoint sites and cylinder gluing;
- a projectively compatible probability law on infinite histories; and
- indefinitely fresh record support because a finite front can keep moving
  outward on full `Z^3`.

It does not get those results for free. The one-ticket weight rule, maximal
synchronous front, sampled actuality, partial-record status, exhaustive ban on
later writes to records, and boundary seed are physical contents of the law.
Most importantly, the normalized CP family does not select which actual
history occurred; the instruction to sample one branch remains explicit.

The construction also exposes two hard engineering facts. A single `M_2`
cannot autonomously carry a full open qubit sector plus two orthogonal record
sectors. And the outward front supplies fresh *global* capacity, not renewable
capacity in a fixed already-recorded patch. The smallest current-carrier
repair for local export is a two-site dual-rail record with migratory identity;
the smallest fixed onsite carrier is dimension three for one blank plus two
records, or dimension four for a full open qubit plus two records.

Finally, this particular minimum law is entanglement-breaking. It is an exact
record-law witness, not a viable final TOE dynamics. A final reference needs a
coherent working process and contextual quantum repertoire in addition to the
front commit architecture.

## The Exact Candidate Law: `CFSI-1`

Call the rule **Causal-Front Sampled Instrument, one-ticket version** or
`CFSI-1`.

### State and local front

A state in the candidate's declared domain is a finite partial record map

```text
C : Z^3 partial-> {0,1}.
```

Absence from `dom(C)` means open; it is history/control semantics, not a third
orthogonal value inside `M_2`. The symbols `0,1` are coordinates in an
unordered orthogonal frame `{P,I-P}` supplied by the finite preparation or
boundary record, not a basis chosen by bare `M_2(C)`. The present candidate is
defined on common-frame record configurations. Simultaneously conjugating
every record projector and branch map by any one-site unitary gives the same
physical law in a different frame. A law on mixed-frame neighborhoods would
need an additional relational transport/context rule; `CFSI-1` does not hide
one.

For every site `x`, let `N(x)` be its six cubic nearest neighbors and define

```text
F(C) = {x not in dom(C) : N(x) intersects dom(C)}.
```

`F(C)` is the ready causal front. If `C` is finite, so is `F(C)`.

For `r=0,1`, let

```text
n_r(x,C) = number of y in N(x) with C(y)=r,
n(x,C)   = n_0+n_1.
```

At a ready site,

```text
A_x(C)       = {r : n_r(x,C)>0},
p_x(r | C)   = n_r(x,C)/n(x,C).
```

Thus availability is exactly neighbor-dependent and changes between a
unanimous and a mixed recorded neighborhood. The probability formula is the
one-ticket-per-recorded-neighbor law value. It is stated, not derived from the
word “admissible.”

### Qubit-native atomic instrument

Let `P_0=P` and `P_1=I-P` be the two boundary-relative record projectors of one
`M_2`. For a ready site, define the outcome branch map

```text
J_(x,r)^C(rho) = p_x(r|C) Tr(rho) P_r.
```

An explicit Kraus family is

```text
sqrt(p_r) |r><0|,
sqrt(p_r) |r><1|.
```

Therefore each branch is completely positive,

```text
J_(x,r)^*(I) = p_x(r|C) I,
sum_r J_(x,r)^*(I) = I,
```

and the normalized branch output is exactly `P_r`. Algebraic availability and
positive instrument support coincide in this law.

For a finite region, the predictive state may be decoded from records as

```text
sigma_C = tensor_(x recorded) P_(C(x))
          tensor_(x open) I/2.
```

The atomic map discards the prior open-site state, so no independent phase or
wavefunction is needed for this candidate. That economy is also why the law
is entanglement-breaking and cannot be the complete quantum dynamics.

### One full law step

At one step the law uses the entire old front `F(C)`. The joint branch is the
tensor product of the local instruments, so

```text
p(r_F | C) = product_(x in F(C)) p_x(r_x | C).
```

Exactly one joint tuple is sampled and appended:

```text
C' = C union {(x,r_x) : x in F(C)}.
```

Every future law step acts only on sites outside the current record domain.
The maximal synchronous front is load-bearing: every target reads the same
old record configuration. Permitting a newly written site to trigger a more
distant site before its causal peers finish produces a different law.

### Boundary class and full lattice

The allowed boundary class is a nonempty finite common-frame record seed,
including its unordered orthogonal frame. A particular seed, frame, and
contents are contingent input. The law is translation-, all-24-proper-cubic-,
global-label-, and simultaneous-unitary-frame covariant; translating,
rotating, or conjugating the seed transforms the whole process. A two-label
seed is needed for a genuinely stochastic mixed front. A homogeneous seed is
copied deterministically forever.

Starting from one seed site, after `t` steps the record domain is the Manhattan
ball `B_t`. Its volume and next-shell size are

```text
|B_t|   = (4t^3 + 6t^2 + 8t + 3)/3,
|S_t|   = 4t^2 + 2,                       t>0.
```

Every finite patch eventually fills, but every finite time leaves infinitely
many unused sites. This is a derived fresh-support allocator on full `Z^3`.
It is not bounded-patch renewal and it does not move old records.

## What Is Actually Derived

Conditional on the one exact `CFSI-1` definition:

| interface | theorem inside the candidate |
|---|---|
| event readiness | `F(C)` is determined by the six-neighbor record profile |
| availability | positive labels are exactly labels already present next door |
| atomic normalization | follows from the explicit Kraus completeness relation |
| one-shot statistics | branch traces equal the incidence probabilities |
| record writing | every sampled branch outputs exactly one `P_r` per ready site |
| record identity | the persistent pair is `(site,content)` |
| permanence | follows because the exhaustive next-step domain excludes recorded sites |
| nonreconnection | conflicting same-site append branches have no common append-only extension |
| disjoint composition | tensor-factor branch maps commute |
| gluing | separated fronts factor; adjacent layers compose by conditional kernels |
| projective extension | normalized finite cylinders marginalize, yielding the infinite history measure |
| causal order | front depth orders events |
| fresh support | finite seeds have finite fronts and unbounded outward shells on `Z^3` |

“Exactly one actual history” is conditional on the sampled-law instruction.
Iteration then returns one history; CP normalization alone does not derive the
instruction.

## What The Reference Still Supplies

The exact law reference carries, rather than proves from the four current
axiom sentences:

1. generated finite tensor composition for the local CP maps;
2. the partial-record map and its open-versus-recorded status semantics;
3. the common-frame boundary condition and its relational identification of
   the pointer pair across sites;
4. the exact one-ticket incidence probability value;
5. maximal synchronous front firing;
6. physical sampled actuality;
7. an exhaustive operation scope that never targets a recorded site;
8. the allowed finite-seed boundary class and the actual boundary instance;
9. the identification of event depth with a process step; and
10. any later identification of step count with metric duration.

The first eight are coherent contents of one microscopic law and boundary
contract. Listing them does not imply eight more axioms. It records what the
stable referent means so downstream theorems cannot borrow a different law.

## Minimum Exact-Law-Value Discriminator

The paired-law companion
`COMPLETE_SAMPLED_LAW_PAIR_AXIOM_UNDERDETERMINATION_NOTE_2026-07-14.md`
constructs two laws

```text
q_lambda(r|n) = lambda^(n_r) / sum_s lambda^(n_s),
lambda=1 or 2,
```

with the same carrier, context, menu, support, sampling, append permanence,
gluing, covariance, and fresh-address route. At a `2:1` profile they predict
`1/2` and `2/3`, and one record transcript separates them.

`CFSI-1` predicts `2/3` at that profile because it uses linear incidence, but
it is not the `lambda=2` law: at `3:1` it predicts `3/4`, whereas `lambda=2`
predicts `4/5`.

Therefore this construction does **not select** its weight law from the common
architecture or current axiom prose. It **packages one exact law value**—the
linear-incidence formula—so the model is predictive. Replacing that formula
leaves every structural theorem above intact and changes transcripts. This is
the minimum reason a final stable reference must contain an exact extensional
law value or a proved operational-equivalence class, not merely the phrases
“local,” “sampled,” “covariant,” and “permanent.”

## Three Route Comparison

### Reversible-unitary with a front

A CNOT from a record qubit to a blank front qubit copies `0` or `1`
deterministically. Applied to `|+>|0>`, it produces a Bell state and reverses
exactly under the same CNOT. It derives coherent correlation and can transport
or redundantly export existing content. It does not produce one selected
outcome. A finite unitary also preserves projector rank, so strict monotone
record-support growth requires a restricted forward semigroup, an environment,
or a boundary sector.

This route is the right reversible working layer. It is not the whole commit
law.

### Local sampled CP instrument

`CFSI-1` is the strongest complete route in this cycle. CP completeness gives
normalization, its branch typing writes records, the front gives composition
and fresh support, and the sampling instruction gives one actual successor.
It closes the requested interfaces in one exact model.

Its costs are explicit: it is nonunitary, uses a hybrid record-status map,
imports the one-ticket law and sample instruction, and destroys rather than
propagates unknown open-site quantum information.

### Sector or asymptotic completion

The normalized cylinders define a unique measure on infinite history space,
and incompatible record histories define orthogonal diagonal record sectors.
That gives exact sector separation and asymptotic statistics. The measure is
not one of its support points. Selecting a pure history character or a final
boundary sector supplies actuality; neither follows from normalization or
orthogonality.

This route can relocate the sample instruction into boundary/sector data. It
does not eliminate it.

## Record Status And Minimum Carrier Change

The law distinguishes three statuses semantically:

```text
OPEN, RECORD-0, RECORD-1.
```

One `M_2` supports only two nonzero mutually orthogonal subspaces. `CFSI-1`
respects the present one-`M_2` site by representing `OPEN` as absence from the
record map, not as an onsite readable value. This matches the current
record-configuration ontology, but it means the record-status control is
additional to the bare density matrix.

If status must be autonomous in one fixed onsite carrier:

- one blank state plus two one-dimensional records requires dimension three,
  so the smallest carrier is `M_3`;
- a full two-dimensional open qubit sector plus two one-dimensional record
  sectors requires dimension four, so the smallest carrier is `M_4`.

The smallest no-onsite-change alternative is a two-site dual-rail block:

```text
blank = 00,     record-0 = 10,     record-1 = 01.
```

On a `2 x Z` ladder embedded in `Z^3`, two parallel nearest-neighbor SWAPs move
either record into the next blank block and restore the old block to `00`.
This gives exact local export with one `M_2` per physical site. It also changes
record identity from site-tethered to migratory lineage and supplies a
dimer/ray orientation plus a shift schedule. It is not a free reinterpretation
of same-site permanence.

## Renewal Result

Three meanings must remain separate:

1. **Full-lattice fresh support:** `CFSI-1` succeeds. The active front moves to
   unused sites forever from a finite seed.
2. **Bounded-patch working renewal / same-site renewal:** `CFSI-1` fails. Once
   a patch is recorded, the exhaustive law never operates there again.
3. **Migratory export:** the dual-rail conveyor succeeds conditionally, but
   record identity moves and a routing structure is supplied.

No carrier change is needed for meaning 1. Same-site permanent records and
indefinitely many new records in one finite patch are incompatible by direct
counting. Meanings 2 or 3 require a working/archive split, migratory lineage,
or fresh external support.

## Quantum And TOE Boundary

The replacement channel

```text
rho -> sum_r p_r Tr(rho) P_r
```

is entanglement-breaking. Applied to one half of a Bell state it returns a
product state. It supplies valid qubit CP statistics but not the phase,
contextual, and Bell repertoire required of a quantum TOE.

A serious final candidate should therefore retain the structural front rule
but replace the minimal reset instrument with a reconstructed coherent working
process plus outcome-labelled local instruments. On the present carrier that
requires the record map to say which sites are still coherent and a theorem
that complete records reconstruct the process state. On a fully autonomous
onsite carrier, the open-qubit/record-sector count points to `M_4` or a spatial
block code.

The law also provides event depth, not metric time; a global stochastic
history, not laboratory frequency convergence; and no matter, field, gravity,
or thermodynamic limit.

## Strongest Candidate Reference

The strongest candidate reference produced here is not the classical
one-ticket table alone. It is the following exact architecture with the table
slot required to be extensional:

> **Causal-front sampled instrument law.** A complete record configuration
> determines a finite nearest-neighbor ready front and the conditional state
> and exact normalized CP instrument on that front. One joint branch is
> sampled, appended on fresh support, and thereafter fixed by every exhaustive
> continuation. The compatible finite-front family defines the full-`Z^3`
> process.

`CFSI-1` is one fully executable value of this reference. It proves the
architecture can jointly close readiness, normalized statistics, actuality,
identity, gluing, and fresh support. The paired-law discriminator proves that
the reference is predictive only when “exact normalized CP instrument” points
to an actual table/equation—such as `CFSI-1`—rather than an unconstrained type.

This is suitable theorem-import language for a next derivation cycle. It is
not yet suitable final axiom language because the only completely specified
value tested here is entanglement-breaking and its front schedule, sampling,
status, and boundary contents remain adopted rather than selected.

## Exact Residual Atoms

After taking `CFSI-1` as the referent, the unresolved physics is:

| id | residual |
|---|---|
| `V` | selection or derivation of the exact instrument/law value rather than another admissible table |
| `A` | sampled actuality or an exact physical boundary/sector selector |
| `S` | autonomous physical record-status control, or proof that partial-map status is complete |
| `Q` | coherent contextual/Bell-capable working process reconstructed from records |
| `F` | derivation of the maximal front schedule or a local causal-invariance theorem replacing it |
| `B` | physical allowed boundary class and the contingent actual seed |
| `R` | bounded-patch renewal or migratory export identity if outward consumption is insufficient |
| `T` | metric clock/rate and frequency/trial theorems |
| `D` | matter, continuum, thermodynamics, source, and gravity outputs |

`V/A/S/F/R` are already visible at bare metal. `Q/T/D` are the next TOE
filters. A deeper one-law construction may derive several together; this table
does not declare them independent axioms.

## Constitutional Consequence

The construction supports one narrow drafting conclusion. Referring to one
fixed law from Admissibility can make formation, permanence, composition,
statistics, and fresh support theorem outputs—but only if the reference fixes
an actual law value and exhaustive continuation scope.

The current phrase “one fixed nearest-neighbor admissibility rule” is too weak
to identify `CFSI-1`, the `lambda=1` companion, the `lambda=2` companion, or a
coherent quantum replacement. Adding generic words such as “causal,”
“sampled,” or “front” would not remove that underdetermination.

No live edit is recommended from this model. The right next construction is a
Bell-capable `CFSI-Q` with a record-reconstructible coherent work state and an
exact local front/export dilation. If it exists on one `M_2` plus partial-map
status, it could become the stable referent. If it requires `M_4` or a spatial
block, the carrier change will have been forced by an explicit law rather than
by prose.

## Narrow No-Go Discipline Gate

**Gate result:** `PASS` for the narrow tested-variant claim:

> None of the reversible-unitary, sampled-CP, or sector/asymptotic variants
> tested here derives all three of sampled actuality, autonomous
> `OPEN/RECORD-0/RECORD-1` status inside one `M_2`, and indefinite same-site
> record formation in a fixed finite patch.

This is not a claim that no qubit QCA, global-history law, spatial code, or
boundary construction can close the full target.

### N1 — Alternative-route enumeration

1. **Reversible unitary front — `ATTEMPTED`.** It copies basis records and
   coherently carries alternatives, but its inverse erases the copy and no
   branch variable is selected.
2. **Forward-only unitary semigroup — `ATTEMPTED`.** Excluding the inverse can
   protect a front-relative record, but the semigroup restriction and initial
   blank boundary are extra content and the coherent state still has no one
   outcome.
3. **Local sampled CP front — `ATTEMPTED`, conditional success.** `CFSI-1`
   closes one-history continuation by explicitly sampling, while status remains
   a partial-map flag and bounded patches saturate.
4. **Normalized sector/history measure — `ATTEMPTED`.** It derives compatible
   cylinders and orthogonal record sectors, but a measure is not one selected
   history character.
5. **Deterministic symmetric tie-break — `ATTEMPTED`, ruled out on the exact
   mixed profile.** Global label covariance would require `r=1-r` at a tie.
6. **Outward full-`Z^3` fresh-support front — `ATTEMPTED`, success at global
   scope.** It avoids global saturation but does not renew a fixed recorded
   patch.
7. **Two-site dual-rail conveyor — `ATTEMPTED`, conditional success.** It
   restores a local blank while preserving content, but needs migratory
   identity, two-site blocks, orientation, and a schedule.
8. **Larger onsite status carrier — `ATTEMPTED BY DIMENSION COUNT`.** `M_3`
   closes blank/0/1 status and `M_4` closes open-qubit/0/1 status, but either is
   a carrier change rather than a derivation inside one `M_2`.

### N2 — Wall-independence audit

For the narrow claim, collapse the residual to three walls:

- `A`: an actual-history selector beyond normalized alternatives;
- `S`: autonomous local open/record status inside one `M_2`; and
- `R`: bounded-patch renewal while preserving same-site records.

| pair | closing first closes second? | closing second closes first? | independent in tested class? |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `A,S` | no | no | yes |
| `A,R` | no | no | yes |
| `S,R` | no | no | yes |

The CP sampler closes `A` while leaving `S,R`; the partial record map closes
the control use of `S` while leaving `A,R`; and the infinite fresh front closes
global capacity without selecting a history or adding three onsite sectors.
No wall is counted twice through another.

### N3 — Hidden-wall scan

The exact tensor carrier, boundary-relative unordered pointer frame,
common-frame domain, record-domain flag, synchronous schedule,
linear-incidence weights, sample instruction, exhaustive future operation
scope, and boundary seed are all named supplied contents. A simultaneous
unitary change of frame changes no physical prediction; a mixed-frame law is
not claimed. The enumeration sort order in the runner is non-load-bearing
bookkeeping. No appeal to “standard QFT,” an unnamed background, or a
supposedly natural clock is used.

### N4 — Exact residual matching

| witness | witness residual | residual used here | match? |
|---|---|---|---:|
| `CAUSAL_FRONT_RECORD_PHASE_MINIMUM_MODEL_NOTE_2026-07-14.md:17` | one qubit does not expose a third readable open status | onsite `S` wall | yes |
| `CAUSAL_FRONT_RECORD_PHASE_MINIMUM_MODEL_NOTE_2026-07-14.md:81` | explicit seed supplies actual outcome | `A` wall | yes |
| `FINITE_DIAMOND_SAMPLED_LUDERS_INVARIANT_RECORD_MODEL_NOTE_2026-07-14.md:76` | one sampled tuple is additional to normalized distribution | `A` wall | yes |
| `RECORD_CAPACITY_RENEWAL_CONSTITUTIONAL_PRESSURE_NOTE_2026-07-14.md:22` | finite bounded permanent archive saturates | bounded same-site `R` wall | yes |
| `FULL_LATTICE_FD_SLIR_COMPATIBILITY_AND_MINIMUM_CONTENT_NOTE_2026-07-14.md:175` | indefinite process needs fresh carrier or exact export | fresh-support/export `R` wall | yes |
| `FULL_LAW_INVENTORY_ADVERSARIAL_REDUCTION_NOTE_2026-07-14.md:32` | three orthogonal status sectors exceed one qubit | onsite `S` wall | yes |
| `COMPLETE_SAMPLED_LAW_PAIR_AXIOM_UNDERDETERMINATION_NOTE_2026-07-14.md:24` | one transcript separates complete laws with the same interface | exact law-value `V` residual | yes |

The paired-law discriminator is used only for law-value residual `V`, not as a
witness for `A`, `S`, or `R`.

### N5 — Resolution and rhetoric audit

- The status obstruction is onsite and autonomous. It does not cover a
  history-coded flag, a two-site block, or an operational quotient.
- The renewal obstruction is for a fixed finite patch with site-tethered
  records. It does not cover full-`Z^3` fresh support or migratory identity.
- The unitary result is a finite-carrier branch-selection and rank statement.
  It does not exclude an asymptotic sector or boundary interpretation.
- The law-value discriminator is at one finite `2:1` transcript and a full
  finite profile census in its companion. It is not a classification of every
  local quantum law.

Every negative sentence above uses the corresponding narrow resolution.

### N6 — Partial-closure path

Several walls can close without new axiom prose:

- treat record absence as the existing record-map domain distinction and prove
  predictive completeness from the exact law;
- take one sampled kernel as a named conditional import, prove the full-lattice
  theorem, then attempt to retire its sample atom through a boundary/sector
  construction;
- use full-`Z^3` shell allocation when only global fresh support is required;
  and
- use migratory identity plus the dual-rail export theorem if same-site
  permanence is not the physical law.

These are import-retirement and identity-clarification routes, not automatic
demands for another axiom.

### N7 — Strongest steelman

A hostile reviewer should say that one qubit per site is not the real limit:
an exact quasilocal quantum cellular instrument can encode the open/locked
distinction in its causal history, obtain an actual sector from a low-record
tail boundary, transport record identity in a topological or dual-rail code,
and reconstruct every coherent work state as an operational equivalence class
of complete records. Such a law could preserve local `M_2`, remain cubic
covariant after quotienting schedule gauge, and close `A/S/R` jointly.

That is convincing enough to block a broad no-go. `CFSI-1` is therefore a
partial constructive witness with an honest residual, and the steelman is the
target for `CFSI-Q`.

### N8 — Cross-cycle echo

The status wall appeared in the causal-front phase and full-law inventory
notes; this cycle applies their permitted history-metadata closure rather than
calling for `M_3` immediately. The actuality wall appeared in FD-SLIR; this
cycle bundles the sample instruction visibly and separately tests a sector
relocation. The capacity wall appeared in the renewal note; this cycle retires
global saturation through exact shell allocation while preserving the narrower
bounded-patch residual. The paired-law cycle newly prevents the successful
architecture from being mistaken for selection of its numerical law value.

No similar wall found in the search is treated as retired merely by renaming
it. The prior definition/reframing mechanism is used only where the exact law
proves the same future-record behavior.
