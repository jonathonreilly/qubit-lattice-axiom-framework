# Prospective A-only physical-column projector coefficients

Status: source-only candidate, NOT_READY for execution. No actual acquisition values, native columns, moments, Gram or operator evaluated. This code defines an operator by exact physical column descriptors. It does not produce a numerical wavefunction basis or certify a Gaussian consumer.

## Convention and exact assembly

Use dimensionless H0=iK0, U=[e0,d], ||d||²=2, V=2i[[0,1],[-1,0]]. For each positive midpoint s, G=U*R0(is)U=iM with M=[[sA,-2D],[2D,2sBgeo]], D=(1-s²A)/6, Bgeo=A for P and D for O. Set a=1-4D, d=a²+8s²ABgeo. Then T=(I+VG)^-1V=iQ with

 Q=d^-1[[-8sBgeo,2a],[-2a,-4sA]].

The source computes this from the exact rational midpoint of the A enclosure intersected with [0,1/s²] and checks (I-NM)Q=N exactly, N=V/i. It refuses an empty spectral intersection or nonpositive computed determinant. In the intersection, D>=0 and a>=1/3, so both classes have determinant>=1/9. Enclosure of the actual A(midpoint), and the uniform inverse estimates, are supplied by the bound acquisition and input-budget proof; positivity of an arbitrary supplied scalar alone does not establish a physical resolvent.

With X±=R0(±is)U, RA(is)-R0(is)=-X+ T X-* and the conjugate is its adjoint. Thus the positive-band difference has coefficient -w/(2pi)[[0,T],[T*,0]] in [X+,X-]. The negative-band difference is its negative. core.block_imaginary returns the real skew matrix whose product by i is that Hermitian coefficient. No unannounced rephasing or half-seed normalization is applied.

## Rounding and numerical error

Each real component of Q is rounded to the nearest2^-84 dyadic, ties upward. Error per entry is <=2^-85, so the2x2 operator error is <=2^-84, below the required2^-80. The implementation also computes the actual error and gates twice its largest entry. Final multiplication by midpoints of outward-rounded weight boxes and midpoint reciprocal pi is exact; it introduces no further rounding.

The imported budget is Einput<=2^27 epsA+2^42 rhos+2^13 rhow+5 epsT+2^12 rhopi. Each radius is an absolute radius, not a full width. The planned acquisition supplies fullwidth A<=1e-30 and geometry radii<=2^-160. The separate reciprocal-pi enclosure must have radius<=2^-180. core.reciprocal_pi_box supplies it from pi=16 atan(1/5)-4 atan(1/239), with40 and12 alternating terms. Each alternating tail lies between zero and its signed next term; positive reciprocal reverses the resulting endpoints. The exact radius gate passes in a pure rational control. Future runtime must bind this generator output, rather than accepting an arbitrary narrow box as proof of1/pi.

The function checks exactly378 ordered, separated positive root boxes in [2^-32,16], positive weights, midpoint weight sum<=17, literal integer IDs and declared shapes. This does not prove those roots and weights are the18-panel Gauss21 rule; the future authenticated loader must bind that producer certificate. Both classes use the same A data. No A' is required.

The analytic contribution is the sum of the reviewed low corrected remainder, high N15 remainder and ratio4 p21 quadrature bound. core.analytic_budget implements their exact rational constants. The final ledger is retained before the strict total<1e-12 gate. This bound holds separately for each impurity; it is not a joint sum over both impurity operators.

## Low and high descriptors

For the positive projector, the low approximation is -(epsilon/pi) X0(3V)X0*, X0=H0^-1U and epsilon=2^-32. The stored imaginary2x2 coefficient is therefore [[0,-6epsilon/pi],[6epsilon/pi,0]]. The inverse columns exist by the imported three-dimensional local resolvent estimate. They are exact descriptors, not computed entries.

The high correction is (1/pi) sum n=0..14 (-1)^n (HA^(2n+1)-H0^(2n+1))/((2n+1)16^(2n+1)). Every coefficient is explicit. The polynomial difference has the reviewed finite bare-Krylov representation of degree28/rank<=58; this source records the polynomial operator rather than performing a Gram calculation. Exact rational scalar arithmetic introduces no moment acquisition. These corrections and the node terms use the same positive-band convention and h=1 scaling; restore Hphys=hHbar and dimensionless frequencies consistently with SCALING_BRIDGE.

## Retention, cost and remaining closure

The retain callback must serialize durably before returning; it must not retain mutable Python references. Current inputs, exact/rounded Q, each4x4 imaginary coefficient, and final ledger are emitted. A future dispatcher must retain failures, verify all immutable input/source bytes and close resources. No dispatcher or accepted-input binder exists here.

Fixed work:378 nodes,7562x2 solves,756 residual checks and756 coefficient blocks. It uses no dense matrix larger than4x4. Streaming output contains these coefficients plus15 high coefficients and one low block per class; physical descriptors are symbolic. MAX_BITS32768 bounds stored rational components. Intermediate Fraction products/sums can exceed that before validation (a bounded2x2 sum has a conservative few-times32768 transient bit length); there is no current RSS/time contract. Input parsing and resource guards remain future runtime obligations. No timing forecast is claimed from the synthetic controls.

Fifty original synthetic checks use a deliberately nonnative one-atom scalar law, alternate determinant inversion, polarization/skew adjoints, signed dyadic rounding, malformed input refusal and the exact rational error budget. They are algebraic supporting controls, not an acquired projector certificate. No full378-row synthetic or native assembly ran.

The original1b8c source is preserved in the sibling before-spectral folder. Three additional nonphysical controls confirm the Machin radius, a boundary-straddling valid spectral intersection, and refusal of an empty intersection. Full original controls were not repeated.

## Fixed-grid weight successor

Original5fa4 is preserved whole in the sibling before-weight folder. Authenticated geometry weights can have up to50000-bit rational components. Before any accumulation, each bracket [l,u] is replaced by [floor(2^192 l)/2^192,ceil(2^192 u)/2^192]. Both original and rounded boxes are retained. The NEW candidate uses the rounded-box midpoint. Its radius, charged as rhow, contains the exact mathematical weight and is verified <=2^-160; an original width<=2^-160 gives new radius<=2^-161+2^-192. Positivity is rechecked; a zero lower endpoint refuses. The scale product has at most50192 transient bits, while stored rounded bounds and all weight sums have fixed dyadic denominators. Pole midpoints are unchanged, so the authenticated A evaluation remains at exactly its original argument. No existing candidate or protocol is rewritten. Seven additional synthetic checks cover containment and a40000-bit input denominator; no actual weights read.
