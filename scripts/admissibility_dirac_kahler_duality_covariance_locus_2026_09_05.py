"""BLOCK 215 -- THE COVARIANCE LOCUS OF THE FOUR DUALITY PARAMETERS.

Block 214 exhibited the plane D16 = D34 = -D25 (onsite) and the sum s = 0
(overlap) as the loci where the cone is the union of the two Hodge cones, and
recorded that no premise prefers them.  The Admissibility axiom names one
symmetry: "covariant under lattice translations and proper cubic rotations".
This runner computes EXACTLY what that symmetry does to the four parameters
of Block 211's six-face-compatible cell form, at symbolic moduli, in every
corner-sign gauge class, for EVERY conjugacy class of subgroups of the proper
cubic group O (the classes are computed from the group, not recalled):

  the corner action of O on the eight-corner cell, BUILT HERE from the 3 x 3
  signed permutations (Block 201) as the multiplicative extension through the
  lane's own wedge (the raising part D(kappa) of Block 213/214), verified as a
  representation and as an intertwiner L D(kappa) L^-1 = D(R kappa);
  the star lemma (the Hodge star derived from the lane's wedge; the plane IS
  the star line); the twisted-covariance census (E_R R) H (E_R R)^T = H over
  Block 211's 64 sign vectors, strict and twisted, with the fate of the shears
  reported first; the overlap sum; the controls (positivity, onsite parity,
  the flat cell).  The block's theorem is a CONDITIONAL: IF the cell form is
  twisted-covariant under G THEN the parameters lie on L(G).  Whether the cell
  form inherits the axiom's covariance is a reading, enumerated and not
  licensed.  Nothing is registered and nothing is adopted; no subgroup, no
  assembly, no reading and no parameter value is selected.

Gate families: A authority, B banner and fences, C construction fidelity,
D the star lemma, E the census, F the overlap sum, G the controls, H scope
fences, I note and hygiene.  Every measurement is taken once before any
mutation flag is read; exact arithmetic only -- no float, no nsimplify.
Scout-grade finite exact linear algebra on one cell form, not a spacetime and
not a dynamics.
