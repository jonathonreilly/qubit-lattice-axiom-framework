"""Block 164: THE ZERO-SHEAR REGION.

SCOUT DISCIPLINE, AND IT IS A HARD BOUNDARY.  Every reflection outside the
committed four, every support outside the committed half, and every carrier
outside the committed family exercised here is a REGISTERED-PREMISE-CLASS CHANGE
to the committed framework.  Each one is MEASURED and NONE of them is
registered, adopted, proposed or claimed.  Nothing in this runner edits, retires
or amends any committed note, axiom, premise or convention.

THE CRITERION, IN CLOSED FORM, PROVED ON THE FULL 64-MODULUS CARRIER FAMILY,
ALL 24 INVOLUTIVE SITE REFLECTIONS, ALL 16 HEALED EDGES, SYMBOLIC MASS AND
SYMBOLIC s_x.  At s_t = 0 the half-support site pairing is EXACTLY

    [r Q]_{S,S} = [[ B , C ] , [ C^T , 0 ]] ,      S = {c, c+1}

with the (c+1,c+1) block IDENTICALLY zero, B carrying NO shear modulus, and C a
HOMOGENEOUS LINEAR form in exactly the EIGHT LOCAL shears {b_{c-1,x}, b_{c,x}}.
A hollow corner forces PSD <=> C = 0 and B >= 0; the traceless 2-cycle minors
force pi = id whenever m != 0; hence

    PSD AND MASS-CARRYING  <=>  X-TRIVIAL (e_x, p_x) = (+1, 0)
                            AND m > 0
                            AND sigma = 0 on the TWO TIME LINKS INCIDENT TO
                                the fixed slice c (cells (c-1,x) and (c,x)),

and there [r Q]_{S,S} = m diag(D(c,.)) (+) 0_4 with

    D(t,x) = ( nu_{t,x} + a_{t-1,x} + a_{t,x-1} + mu_{t-1,x-1} ) / 4 .

D IS A LATTICE-HODGE TRACE -- THREE VOLUME MODULI AND ONE INVERSE VOLUME
MODULUS, the inverse sitting on the past-diagonal corner -- and it is
HOMOGENEOUS OF NO DEGREE under nu -> lambda nu.  It is NEVER "a volume average";
that wording is struck on the independent checker's objection and the gate for
this block greps the lattice-Hodge-trace phrasing instead.

THE CONNECTION THEOREM IS THE INDEPENDENT CHECKER'S RESULT AND IT IS CREDITED AS
SUCH; it is RE-VERIFIED here rather than quoted.  P is EXACTLY AFFINE-LINEAR in
s_t (every healed differential entry is a s_t + b s_x, so P is degree <= 1 in
s_t in 384 of 384 cells) -- so the question Block 163 handed forward as
"perturbative" has an EXACT answer at all magnitudes and both signs: on the
region dB/ds_t = 0, the corner is exactly s_t E with E TRACELESS and a pure form
in the FREE shears, and the off-diagonal block is exactly s_t C1 with C1 never
zero.  NOTHING SURVIVES SWITCHING s_t ON.

THREE DEFECTS OF THIS BLOCK'S OWN SOLVE TRANSCRIPT ARE FOLDED, EACH QUOTED THEN
CORRECTED.  (S1) "the healing weights enter only through s_t, so at s_t = 0 they
drop out entirely" is FALSE and is STRUCK: at s_t = 0 the edge is live in 24 of
24 labels and, after the local shears are pinned, still live in 16 of 24; the
true mechanism is that the edge dependence carries ZERO MASS in 360 of 360
comparisons and therefore enters only through s_x, which on the x-trivial class
lives entirely in C -- so EDGE-BLINDNESS FOLLOWS FROM C = 0.  (S2) the failure
counts of the two earlier characterizations are attached to the WRONG BENCH: 64
+ 64 and 96 are the m = 1 sub-bench (2688 cells); on the three-mass 8064-cell
bench the same guesses cost 128 + 128 and 320.  Both figures are displayed and
correctly attributed.  (S3) "stabilizer of order 8" is a CATEGORY ERROR and is
STRUCK: {0,3} x Z_4 is not closed under addition, so it is a DWELL SET and not a
subgroup; the general-element region-preserving translation group has order 4.

ONE REFINEMENT THIS RUNNER ADDS TO THE CHECKER'S OWN STATEMENT, disclosed rather
than smoothed: the checker's "on a carrier with any free shear, E != 0" holds on
the ODD fixed slices only.  E is nonzero in exactly 32 of the 64 region cells --
c in {1,3}, matching the checker's own 192-of-384 corner measurement -- and is
identically zero at c in {0,2}, where the hollow-corner lemma applies at EVERY
s_t and the C = s_t C1 branch closes the theorem by itself.  The theorem is
unchanged; its proof has two branches and both are exhibited.

NO HARDCODED CERTIFICATE ANYWHERE: every printed numeral is recomputed in the
measurement pass from the committed constructors reached through the LANDED
Block 163 runner, and no check is registered as a literal True.  Exact SymPy
throughout; no float enters any measured object, which is itself gated.  The
integer monotonic clock is used only for the runtime gate.

PROVENANCE DISCLOSURE: the four-chart shear atlas, the local differential, the
64-modulus carrier model and its admissible cone, the cover Hodge, the
antiperiodic quotient and its lift, the sixteen healed edge differentials and
their healing weights, the reflection move machinery and its covariance
condition, the staggered grading X_0, the quotient action, the Block 144
symmetric-congruence inertia helper, and Block 163's descent, involution
enumeration, half support, selector and pairing functor are ALL COMMITTED
objects, imported through the Block 163 runner (b163 -> b162 -> b161 -> b160 ->
b159 -> b156 -> b153 -> b148 -> b147 -> b145 -> b142) and never re-derived.
External lattice-gauge, staggered-fermion and Osterwalder-Schrader literature is
REFERENCED nowhere and BORROWED nowhere; every statement is re-proved
in-framework.

HYPOTHESES, named and not imported.  (H1) the pairing convention is
[r Q]_{S,S} = herm(Sel_S^T r Q Sel_S) on the half support S = {c, c+1}.
(H3) "positive" is a statement about the Hermitian part.  (H4) the physical cone
is nu > 0, |sigma| < 1 per cell.  (H1-163) a PSD verdict here is a statement
about THIS pairing functor on THESE supports over THESE carriers and about no
wider class of objects; "PSD" means no negative direction AND a nonzero positive
count, so the zero form is never counted as a positive.  (H1-164) the region is
read in the 32 real carrier coordinates (16 volumes, 16 shears) and the
64-modulus family is its free relaxation, in which nu, a, b and mu are
independent symbols; a statement proved on the free family holds on the cone.

N5_FENCE = 'N5: per_element: THE BLOCK THEOREM AT s_t = 0, ON THE FULL 64-MODULUS FAMILY. For every one of the 24 involutive site reflections, every one of the 16 healed edges, symbolic m and symbolic s_x, the half-support site pairing on S = {c, c+1} is EXACTLY [[B, C],[C^T, 0]]: the (c+1,c+1) block is IDENTICALLY ZERO in 384 of 384 cells -- Block 163 had this only on FLAT carriers -- B carries NO shear modulus at all in 384 of 384, and C is a HOMOGENEOUS LINEAR FORM in exactly the EIGHT LOCAL shears {b_{c-1,x}, b_{c,x}} in 384 of 384. The variables separate: SHEAR LIVES ONLY IN C, mass and volume only in B. At s_t = 0 the residue is exactly s_x Ktilde, homogeneous of degree 1 on all 16 edges, whose slice-diagonal blocks are REAL ANTISYMMETRIC -- which is why s_x cancels from B for the x-trivial class (64 of 64) and for no other (320 of 320 s_x-live), while it is live in C in all 384.\nper_site: THE CRITERION, IN CLOSED FORM. A hollow corner forces PSD <=> C = 0 and B >= 0. On every 2-cycle of pi(x) = e_x(x - p_x) the principal 2x2 minor of B is TRACELESS in 1024 of 1024 slots with off-diagonal m(D_x + D_y)/2, and a traceless symmetric 2x2 is PSD only if zero, so m != 0 forces pi = id. Hence PSD AND MASS-CARRYING <=> X-TRIVIAL (e_x, p_x) = (+1,0) AND m > 0 AND sigma = 0 on the TWO TIME LINKS INCIDENT TO THE FIXED SLICE c, cells (c-1,x) and (c,x) -- the other two links FREE. On the region [r Q]_{S,S} = m diag(D(c,.)) (+) 0_4 at inertia (4,4,0), edge-free and s_x-free, with D(t,x) = (nu_{t,x} + a_{t-1,x} + a_{t,x-1} + mu_{t-1,x-1})/4. Verified against direct inertia on 8064 of 8064 cells, 0 disagreements, 448 PSD all at (4,4,0); Block 163\'s 64 cells and its exact witness diag(1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0) reproduced from the criterion with no computation.\nper_mode: THE SHAPE. One OPEN 24-dimensional region of codimension 8 per fixed slice c inside the 32-coordinate cone: 8 shear coordinates pinned to zero, the other 8 free in (-1,1), all 16 volumes free and positive. EVERY COVARIANT REFLECTION HAS AN EMPTY REGION -- none of the 16 covariant involutions is x-trivial, and (+1,2) is fixed-point-free -- so the positive object lives on the NON-COVARIANT class. Multi-slice shear stays PSD: single-slice support is NOT forced. Both earlier characterizations fail in BOTH directions, and their counts are stated at their true bench: Block 163\'s checker guess {c, c+1} costs 128 + 128 cells on the 8064-cell three-mass bench and 64 + 64 on the 2688-cell m = 1 sub-bench; Block 163\'s scout guess {H_q diagonal} x {x-trivial} costs 320 and 96 respectively.\nper_block: THE CONJUNCTION, AND IT SPLITS. On the region spec([r Q]_{S,S}) = {m D(c,x)} U {0,0,0,0}: POSITIVE, MASS-CARRYING at rank 4, and HODGE-TRACE-SENSITIVE -- four distinct positive eigenvalues (79/112, 15/16, 49/48, 6/5) on a cone-admissible genuinely curved element with non-diagonal H_q. That conjunction had not occurred in the lane before. BUT sigma NEVER enters a positive eigenvalue, and that is FORCED rather than observed: the two a-cells and the mu-cell of D(c,x) all sit INSIDE the two pinned link slices, so D is literally sigma-free there. The shear sector is LOCUS SELECTION ONLY -- the recording-rule pattern\'s second appearance -- and D itself is a LATTICE-HODGE TRACE, three volume moduli plus one INVERSE volume modulus on the past-diagonal corner, homogeneous of NO degree under nu -> lambda nu. And the whole object sits at s_t = 0, ZERO TEMPORAL CONNECTION, on a class that is not in b148.COVARIANT_MOVES.\nlattice_wide: THE CONNECTION THEOREM (the independent checker\'s result, checker-measured and RE-VERIFIED here). Every healed differential entry is a s_t + b s_x, so P is EXACTLY AFFINE-LINEAR in s_t in 384 of 384 cells: the question is NOT A PERTURBATIVE QUESTION. On the region dB/ds_t = 0 in 64 of 64 -- the mass block is s_t-blind -- the corner is exactly s_t E with E TRACELESS in 64 of 64 and a PURE FORM IN THE FREE SHEARS in 64 of 64 (no nu, no a, no mu, no m, no s_x), and C is exactly s_t C1 with C1 nonzero in 64 of 64. TWO BRANCHES, both exhibited: where E is nonzero -- exactly the odd fixed slices, 32 of 64 region cells, matching the checker\'s own 192 of 384 corner count -- a nonzero traceless symmetric block is indefinite, so P fails PSD for EITHER SIGN of s_t; where E vanishes the hollow-corner lemma applies at every s_t and C = s_t C1 forces s_t = 0. NOTHING SURVIVES SWITCHING s_t ON, exactly, at every magnitude and both signs.\nRESULT: THE POSITIVE REGION OF THE SITE CLASS EXISTS EXACTLY AT ZERO TEMPORAL CONNECTION, WITH NECESSITY AND SUFFICIENCY IN CLOSED FORM ON BOTH SIDES. Three defects of this block\'s own solve transcript are quoted then corrected: the edge-blindness mechanism is STRUCK -- at s_t = 0 the healing weights are live in 24 of 24 labels and in 16 of 24 even after pinning, the edge dependence carries ZERO MASS in 360 of 360 comparisons and enters only through s_x, so edge-blindness FOLLOWS FROM C = 0 and x-triviality; the two failure counts are re-attached to their true benches; and "stabilizer of order 8" is a category error, {0,3} x Z_4 not being closed under addition -- it is a DWELL SET, and the general element\'s region-preserving translations have order 4.\nDECISION_CUT: THE ARC IS COMPLETE AT THIS FIXTURE AND NOTHING IS REGISTERED, ADOPTED OR PROPOSED. No site reflection is adopted; no premise-class change is registered; no landed note is edited; Block 160 is NOT corrected, Block 162 is NOT corrected and Block 163 is NOT corrected. The riders stand at corrected scope: FLIP is a congruence on the WHOLE s_t = 0 slice (384 of 384), P(-m, -s_x) = -P(m, s_x) identically, the region is translation-EQUIVARIANT with R_c -> R_{c+dt}, and dP/ds_x = 0 on the region to all orders. REMAINING OPEN: the pool-2 handoff items (contract E; the cutting residuals; the signed-flux census); the loci-atlas verification, which the checker did not verify; and any owner-directed continuation. TOOLING: sympy.nsimplify can return an irrational radical form for an exact Rational and silently corrupt exact arithmetic -- flagged for the repo, with the landed chain to be grepped in pool 2; the inherited b145.moduli_from_field float leak and the landed inertia helper\'s singular-input sentinel are carried.\nTOE: zero axiom retirement; zero obligation retirement; zero TOE movement; no TOE percentage moves; retained-positive end-to-end theory count remains zero.'
