"""The corner kernel's two cubic carriers, the C3 split, and registered block weights.

Self-contained finite-cluster runner.  The carrier is the eight-dimensional
kernel of the Kawamoto-Smit (KS) staggered hopping written on the coarse
lattice 2Z^3, at the Brillouin-zone corner q = (pi, pi, pi); the cell algebra
is the Cl(6) set

    Gamma = (Y1, Z1 Y2, Z1 Z2 Y3),   Xi = (X1, Z1 X2, Z1 Z2 X3),
    epsilon = Z1 Z2 Z3,              T = i Gamma_1 Gamma_2 Gamma_3.

  A  CARRIERS.  The eight corner states carry a genuine representation of the
     proper cubic group O with characters (8, 2, 0, 4, 0) = 2 A1 + 2 T1, whose
     isotypic projectors in the corner basis are exactly P_A1 = P_hw0 + P_hw3
     and P_T1 = P_hw1 + P_hw2: the two three-dimensional cubic carriers are
     exactly the two Hamming-weight triplets of the landed grading.
  B  GRADING AND MULTIPLICITY.  The 1+3+3+1 grading is the eigen-grading of the
     O-invariant bilinear i sum_a Gamma_a Xi_a = Z1 + Z2 + Z3; the T1 isotypic
     is T1 (x) C^2 with a four-dimensional commutant, so the group alone does
     not split it; T is O-invariant, unitary, exchanges the two triplets and
     anticommutes with epsilon.
  C  C3 SPLIT.  On each triplet the C3[111] restriction has trace 0 and cube I,
     its invariant vector has corner weights exactly 1/3, and the singlet and
     doublet projectors commute with it.
  D  REGISTERED WEIGHTS.  Twelve stipulated bilinears restrict to exactly
     circulant operators; none has both a diagonal and an off-diagonal part, so
     every hw-diagonal one registers r = 0; and the restriction map from real
     C3-invariant Hermitian quadratics onto the circulant algebra is onto, so
     every r in [0, inf) is realised by stipulated coefficients.
  E  INVARIANCE CENSUS.  All six relabellings of each triplet and all 24 cubic
     conjugations leave (a, |b|, r) unchanged with residual 0; naming C^2 rather
     than C as the generator sends delta -> -delta and fixes (a, |b|, r).
  F  CARRIER LOCUS.  Exactly which listed operators separate the two triplets.

Every check is exact: integer and Z[i] matrix arithmetic at zero tolerance,
exact rational character and projector arithmetic, sympy symbolic identities in
the three momenta, and exact Gaussian-rational circulant decomposition.

No corner is named, no bijection to a labelled 3-set is built, no sort key, no
Vandermonde sign, no PDG value and no species name appears.

Output: one PASS/FAIL line per check and a final `TOTAL: PASS=N FAIL=M`.
Exit code 0 iff FAIL = 0.
