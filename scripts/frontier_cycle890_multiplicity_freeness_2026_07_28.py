"""Cycle 890: PRICE MULTIPLICITY-FREENESS -- Cycle 888's named FIND-5.

Cycle 883 derived the readout weight pair (1, 2) at the C3 scope "with no free
parameter" (SL1).  Cycle 886 showed no axiom-grounded selector isolates C3
among the CYCLIC scopes.  Cycle 888 completed the census over all thirty
subgroups of the proper cubic rotation group and proved the SL1 transfer to S3
is NUMERICALLY_TRANSFERS_BUT_THE_SUBSPACE_IS_NOT_FORCED: at S3 the 2-dimensional
irreducible occurs with multiplicity 2, so the realizing subspace is a P^1
family, while at C3 and C4 every multiplicity is 1 and the decomposition is
canonical.  Cycle 888's own conclusion -- **SL1's "no free parameter" IS
multiplicity-freeness of the readout representation** -- left one question
UNPRICED and named it FIND-5: is multiplicity-freeness quotable from any axiom
sentence?  This cycle prices it.

H1  THE THEOREM HALF (positive, machine-verified over the full census).

    T1  For every conjugacy class of subgroups and every readout scope (the
        maximal-free-orbit scope where it exists, and the whole-shell scope),
        the readout decomposition is CANONICAL if and only if the readout
        representation is MULTIPLICITY-FREE.  The two sides are computed by
        SEPARATE, NON-COMMUNICATING routes:

          SIDE A (geometric canonicity).  Irreducible submodules are exhibited
          by exhaustive enumeration of cyclic submodules over an integer grid,
          a direct-sum decomposition is built and gated to span the space, the
          summands are grouped by EXPLICIT intertwiner spaces, and for each
          isomorphism class the moduli of realizing subspaces is computed as
          dim_Q Hom_A(U, M) - dim_Q End_A(U).  Zero means a single point;
          positive means a family, and an explicit one-parameter family of
          distinct submodules is CONSTRUCTED and verified.

          SIDE B (algebraic multiplicity-freeness).  The enveloping algebra
          A = span{rho(h)} is built exactly, its centre is solved for, a
          generator of the centre is found, its minimal polynomial is factored
          over Q, the isotypic components are the kernels of the factors, and
          each rational irreducible degree is recovered from
          dim_Q A_i = d_i^2 / [F_i : Q].  Multiplicity-free means every fine
          multiplicity is <= 1.

        BOTH sides carry the Cycle-888 FIND-3 safety gate independently:
        sum_i m_i^2 [F_i : Q] must equal the number of orbits of the subgroup
        on X x X.  (Naive minimal-cyclic-submodule peeling is UNSAFE on this
        lattice -- at V_edge the first peeled block is 2-dimensional and
        reducible.)

    T2  Multiplicity-freeness at a scope IMPLIES the SL1-type pair is forced.
        Verified at C3 and C4 (forced), at S3 (not forced), and at every other
        class carrying a free shell orbit.

    T3  THE LADDER SHARPENING.  The honest scope menu is RECOMPUTED (classes
        with a lattice-realized free shell orbit of length > 1), and the exact
        subset on which BOTH (a) a v_2 = 1 datum exists under at least one
        reading AND (b) the realization is forced is computed -- at the orbit
        scope, at the shell scope, scope-coherently, and under the deliberately
        loosened scope-MISMATCHED reading, so that nothing can sneak in under a
        reading this runner skipped.  The off-menu counterfactual is computed
        too, so the work done by the realizability rule is visible.

H2  THE PRICING HALF (the FIND-5 sweep).  EVERY sentence of the pinned axiom
    memo, of both Gate-B notes carried by this lineage, and of the readout
    derivation obligation is enumerated by a BYTE-EXACT segmentation -- the
    segments concatenate back to the file, character for character, so the
    sweep's completeness is a reconstruction proof and not a promise.  Each
    prose segment gets an honest grounding attempt for multiplicity-freeness
    or any equivalent/implying property (canonical decomposition; uniqueness of
    the invariant complement; "the readout is determined by ..."; rigidity
    language), graded EXACT / PARTIAL / NONE against a declared three-element
    rubric with a provenance-polarity gate, and the FULL grade distribution is
    reported -- not a cherry-picked subset.

    The verdict is data: QUOTABLE if some sentence grades EXACT (the scope
    ladder then closes as a derivation), NOT_QUOTABLE if the grade ceiling is
    PARTIAL or NONE (multiplicity-freeness is then the ladder's terminal
    supplied clause).  Every gate in this runner passes identically under both
    verdicts; a synthetic forced-EXACT rerun proves it.

All cited artifacts are SHA-256 and git-blob pinned, read as text/AST/JSON
only, and blocked from import by a meta-path firewall.  Every certified
quantity is exact (`int` / `Fraction`); no floating point enters a certificate.
