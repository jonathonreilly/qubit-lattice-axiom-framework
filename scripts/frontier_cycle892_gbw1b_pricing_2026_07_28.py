"""Cycle 892: GBW1b -- price the kernel-window JOINT obligation.

Cycle 885 split `GBW1` into `GBW1a` (the window LOCUS, priced down to
conventions) and `GBW1b` (the terminal normalization `N`), and showed `N` is a
JOINT kernel-window obligation: the exact quantity

    Z(cfg, theta, W) = sum over window sites x in W of |A(x)|^2

moves with the kernel phase gain `theta` on 7 of 12 configurations.  Cycle 887
then proved the READOUT-GAUGE THEOREM: 9 of its 12 admissible catalogue maps
give an IDENTICAL axiom-level scalar readout `I_W` on every configuration --
the whole window-inflation freedom is invisible to the LINEAR readout.

`Z` is QUADRATIC in amplitudes.  This cycle asks the one theorem-shaped
question that separates the two orders.

Q1  IS THE WINDOW EXTENT STILL GAUGE AT QUADRATIC ORDER?  The containment-
    holding admissible catalogue of 887 is rebuilt by AST extraction from the
    pinned 887 primary, the 12-configuration family is rebuilt by AST
    extraction from the pinned 885 primary, and the full map
    `(W, theta) -> Z(cfg, theta, W)` is computed in exact arithmetic over a
    six-value theta grid.  The catalogue is then PARTITIONED by Z-behaviour.
    Both orders are computed and reported regardless of which way the verdict
    lands: the linear gauge verification (887's `I_W` row) AND the quadratic
    partition.

    The structural proof is ATTEMPTED, not assumed.  Certificate `E` computes
    WHERE AMPLITUDE ACTUALLY LIVES: the propagation barrier is `B(R) =
    supp(R)`, the walk may not step onto a blocked site, so the reachable set
    is computed and intersected with the support.  Whichever way that lands,
    it decides the collapse: if amplitude were confined to the barrier every
    containment-holding window would read the same amplitude set and the
    collapse would be a theorem; if amplitude is EXPELLED from the barrier the
    windows differ precisely on the sites that carry all of it.

Q2  THE GBW1b OBLIGATION MAP.  Four components are priced from computed facts
    only:

    (a) WINDOW      -- zero dimensions if Q1 collapses, the named convention
                       with its exact separating witnesses if not.
    (b) KERNEL      -- theta's exact role.  Certificate `H` characterizes
                       `Z(theta)` structurally: the per-edge gain is the exact
                       unit-circle point `u(theta)`, so `A` decomposes by PATH
                       LENGTH and `Z` is a PATH-LENGTH INTERFERENCE SPECTRUM.
                       The identity is CHECKED exactly on every (window,
                       config, theta) triple, and the interference orders that
                       actually appear are computed, not assumed.
    (c) INTERFACE   -- the linear-readout / quadratic-amplitude identification
                       the composed-record event-space step must supply.  This
                       lineage does NOT carry the Cycle-878 event-space
                       artifacts; their absence is COMPUTED by a tracked-file
                       scan with published globs and counts (883 discipline)
                       and they are never reconstructed.  The interface is
                       priced as a named import whose required properties are
                       DERIVED FROM Z'S COMPUTED STRUCTURE -- what Z is
                       measured to be and measured not to be -- and not from
                       what Born's rule says a weight should be.  Certificate
                       `J` carries a needle check that no Born-rule vocabulary
                       enters as a premise.
    (d) RESIDUAL    -- the final pricing row: GBW1b's residual dimension given
                       each import.

DISCIPLINE.  Every pinned input is fixed by full path + sha256 + git blob and
read as TEXT / AST / JSON only; a meta-path firewall makes importing any of
them an error and the hit count is gated at zero.  Every certified quantity is
exact (`Fraction`, exact Gaussian rationals); no floating point enters any
certified value.  The science block is built TWICE and the digests compared.
The gates are outcome-neutral: they require the family digest to match the
value 887 published for the same AST-extracted family, the catalogue to be
COMPLETE (every named map evaluated), BOTH orders to be computed, the theta
grid to be complete, and the restriction gate to reproduce the pinned 885 and
887 rows -- none of them requires a particular verdict.

RESTRICTION GATE (888-style).  Certificate `B` reproduces, BEFORE any new
claim: 885's N-certificate boundary-shell rows value-for-value out of the
pinned 885 runner cache (not merely its 7/12 headline), 885's degenerate-window
control (0/12), and 887's readout-gauge row (9 of 12 admissible maps
indistinguishable) out of the pinned 887 receipt.  A mismatch fails the gate
and no downstream claim is issued.

STRESS.  Certificate `K` requires: an impostor window that BREAKS containment
is excluded by the catalogue filter rather than silently included; a
non-admissible map is refused; and a PLANTED Z-difference -- a mutated
amplitude field -- is DETECTED by the partition, proving the partition can see
a gauge break if one exists (889-style falsifier visibility).

SCOPE, HONESTLY.  One 12-configuration family in a box of radius 4 with walk
depth 4, one catalogue of 17 window maps of which 12 are admissible and 9 hold
containment, one six-value theta grid.  The confinement statement in `E` and
the monotonicity statement in `G` are proved as theorems ON THESE HYPOTHESES
(finite box, blocked-barrier walk, containment-holding windows) and the
catalogue instantiates them; the catalogue itself is not a proof that no
window map anywhere behaves otherwise, and that limit is stated in the verdict.
