"""Cycle 904: the mixed-degree census -- pricing the last unpriced shape.

Cycle 882 (pinned) proved C882-T1: a constraint system on the readout scale
`alpha` that is homogeneous OF A SINGLE DEGREE has solution set {0} or Q, never
a nonzero singleton.  Its own independent checker flagged the escape and did
not develop it: MIXED-degree relations leave the dichotomy, because
`alpha^2 = c alpha` has solution set `{0, c}`.  The sibling census (Cycle 898,
branch `blockG21`, ABSENT from this worktree and disclosed as cross-branch with
computed scan counts) closed every OTHER shape and declared exactly one shape
unpriced: NON-INVOLUTION MIXED-DEGREE RELATIONS.

THIS cycle prices that shape and closes the coverage map.

The pricing is target-independent by construction.  The question is not "does
`2/27` appear" but "does ANY native mixed-degree relation SELECT any nonzero
readout scale".  Reaching and selecting are different questions and this runner
keeps them apart at every step.

(A) THE GENERATOR SPACE, DECLARED AND BOUNDED.  The free `C_n` orbit's supplied
    structure is rebuilt as exact rational matrices (identity, cyclic
    permutation, orbit adjacency, degree, Laplacian, all-ones, group-averaging
    projector, its complement, and declared matrix powers).  Every native
    scalar ATOM is an evaluation of a declared functional on one of those
    matrices, or a declared structural count (orbit length, isotype dimensions,
    the 24-element proper cubic rotation group rebuilt from the Lattice axiom,
    the six nearest neighbours, the lattice dimension).  Each atom carries its
    provenance string.  Closure rules -- products, quotients, sums -- and the
    word bound `W`, height bound `H` and degree cap `D` are declared, published
    in the receipt, and swept.

(B) THE REACHABLE-VALUE THEOREM.  Because Record additivity plus `C_n`
    covariance force `I(x) = alpha * sum_i x_i`, EVERY native degree-`d`
    readout-derived quantity is `k * alpha^d` with `k` a native coefficient.  A
    mixed-degree relation is therefore a polynomial with native coefficients,
    and its solution set is computed exactly over Q by the rational root
    theorem -- no numerics anywhere.  The full reachable value set is computed,
    not sampled, and its 3-adic structure is enumerated exactly.

(C) THE OUTCOME, WHICH IS NOT THE ONE THE BRIEF PREDICTED.  The brief predicted
    a negative by 3-adic valuation: native constants have `v3` in {0, 1, -1}, so
    `v3 = -3` should be out of reach.  That premise is FALSE and this runner
    says so: `1^T J 1 = n^2 = 9` is a single native evaluation with `v3 = 2`,
    and `diag(Q_perp) = (n-1)/n = 2/3` has `v3 = -1`, so their quotient has
    `v3 = -3` at word length ONE.  The target IS reached, at the tightest level
    of the space, by `diag(Q_perp) / (1^T J 1)`, whose value is `(n-1)/n^3`
    UNIFORMLY in `n` -- the exact general-scope readout scale, not a
    scope-tuned coincidence.  The shape is nevertheless closed, by a different
    and stronger argument: the same schema alphabet produces 158 distinct
    uniform-in-`n` value families and 59 distinct values at `n = 3`, so
    membership in the reachable set carries no selection.  The obstruction is
    not reachability.  It is discrimination.

(D) BOUND ROBUSTNESS.  The negative verdict is proved MONOTONE: enlarging the
    atom set, the word bound, the height bound or the degree cap can only
    enlarge the reachable set and the family count, so no bound attack can
    overturn "reaches but does not select" -- a successful bound attack
    strengthens it.  The falsifiable content is therefore placed in the sharp
    MINIMALITY claims (minimal word length to the target, exact `v3` reach per
    degree gap, exact family counts), which a checker can and should attack.

(E) FALSIFIER VISIBILITY.  Four relations are planted, each engineered to pin
    `2/27` while looking native.  The census must DETECT each as pinning the
    target and the nativeness adjudication must flag each one's defect.

No floating point enters any certified quantity.  Cited artifacts are read as
text/AST/JSON only and are blocked from import by a meta-path firewall.
