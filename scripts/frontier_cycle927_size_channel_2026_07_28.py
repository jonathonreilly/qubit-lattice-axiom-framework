"""Cycle 927 -- THE SECOND CHANNEL: is the loop-independent cost carried by FRAGMENT SIZE?

THE MEASURED PHENOMENON THIS BLOCK EXPLAINS.  Three pinned receipts set it up:

  Cycle 917 (14-cell geometry ladder, frozen route-C certification gates):
    max R_ind over the window equals the pointer degree on all seven geometries at
    lambda = 0.05; at lambda = 0.10 the equality survives on every LOOP-FREE geometry
    and fails on the loopy ones.  A GRADED FIELD CEILING is reported as a declared
    non-claim diagnostic: degree 2 -> 0.05, degrees 3-4 -> ~0.075, degree 6 -> 0.10,
    with the threshold BRACKETED in (4, 6].
  Cycle 919 (degree-5 block): degree 5 certifies at 0.10 on all four geometries, so
    the bracket collapses to the singleton {5}: "degree 2 -> 0.05; degrees 3-4 ->
    0.075; degrees 5-6 -> 0.10", threshold LOCATED at degree 5.
  Cycle 921 (loop-cost block): the loop cost is the PAIR-CYCLE LAW -- a per-pair tax
    graded by the shortest pointer-through cycle length, ceiling = independence number
    of the survivors, loop-free geometries pay NOTHING.  Exactly one exception is
    carried openly: 917's degree-2 chain G1 at lambda = 0.10, predicted ceiling 2,
    measured 1.  Its two arms sit at infinite anchor distance, so the pair-cycle law
    predicts no cost; the drop comes from a SECOND, LOOP-INDEPENDENT channel that the
    921 note reports as growing with fragment size and field (G1's 4-site arms reach
    C_ab = 0.0217, just over the 0.02 dependence gate).  Cycle 927 is its named
    successor.

WHAT THIS BLOCK MEASURES.

  Q1 -- THE SIZE LAW.  LOOP-FREE geometry families only, so the pair-cycle law
  predicts ZERO cost on every cell and any observed cost isolates the second channel.
  Symmetric spiders sweep arm length at fixed pointer degree (degree 2: arms 1..7;
  degree 3: 1..5; degrees 4 and 5: 1..3 -- the 2^16 full-space cap is respected and
  every capped extension is declared) and degree at fixed arm length.  Per cell: the
  full R_ind ledger, C_ab on every fragment pair at the ceiling row, theta_A, xi_reg.
  Deliverable: C_ab-vs-(arm length, field) with the 0.02 gate crossings located, the
  size law as the evidence supports it, and the PAIR-vs-CONTENT question decided by
  measurement (which pairs go dependent, and whether fragments fail the content gate
  as they do in the pair-cycle law's d = 1 tier).

  Q2 -- THE MECHANISM.  Structural predictors, every one a pure function of the graph
  and the frozen partition, DECLARED AND COMPUTED BEFORE ANY PROPAGATOR RUNS (the 921
  discipline), each with a discriminating prediction on named cells:
    (a) WITHIN-ARM MIXING          scales with arm Hilbert dimension  -> 2^|F|
    (b) RECURRENCE                 scales with arm depth / revival time -> ecc(F)
    (c) BOUNDARY CONTENT           only the far end decouples -> leaf count
    (d) SPECTRAL CROWDING          level spacing of the arm shrinks -> min gap
    (e) ARITY DILUTION             the pointer is shared among deg(S) arms
    (f) SYSTEM SIZE                the n confound, carried as a rival not a nuisance
  The discriminators: SHAPE cells hold fragment SIZE fixed and vary arm shape (a path
  of 4, a claw of 4, a tee of 4 -- identical n, identical degree, identical arm
  Hilbert dimension, different depth / leaves / spectrum); ASYMMETRIC spiders (one
  long arm, the rest singletons) separate a PER-PAIR mechanism from a PER-GEOMETRY
  one; an extended-window probe separates a WINDOW effect from a STATE effect.

  Q3 -- THE UNIFICATION QUESTION.  Is 917/919's degree-graded field ceiling actually
  carried by FRAGMENT SIZE rather than degree?  In the 917/919 ladder the two
  co-vary: the chain has 4-site arms and certifies only at 0.05, the star has 1-site
  fragments and certifies at 0.10.  Matched designs decide it:
    (A) FIXED DEGREE, VARIED SIZE   -- does the certifying-field ceiling move?
    (B) FIXED SIZE, VARIED DEGREE   -- does it stay?
    (C) FIXED n, VARIED (degree, size) -- the n control; note that for a symmetric
        spider n = 1 + degree * size, so any two of the three fix the third.  That
        three-way coupling is UNAVOIDABLE on symmetric families and is declared, not
        hidden; the ARITY LADDER breaks it by holding one long-arm PAIR fixed and
        adding singleton arms, which moves degree and n while the pair is untouched.
  Either outcome is the headline.  If size carries the grading at fixed degree and
  degree does not move it at fixed size, the 919 "threshold at degree 5" claim needs
  a scope qualifier; if degree carries it at fixed size, the 919 claim hardens.

RESTRICTION GATES.  Before any new number: the partition rule reproduces the frozen
memo's own six published cube fragment lists; all six Cycle 917 geometries and all
four Cycle 919 degree-5 geometries are reproduced VALUE-FOR-VALUE against the pinned
receipts (row by row: chi, C_ab, theta_A, H_Z, the R_ind ledger, xi_reg, max R_ind,
witness, verdict, event); the G1 EXCEPTION cell is reproduced with its C_ab margin;
all 32 Cycle 921 DESIGNED geometries are reproduced value-for-value at both frozen
fields including their per-pair dependence margins; and the 21 frozen constants are
byte-verified out of the frozen memo and cross-checked quote-for-quote against the
pinned 917, 919 and 921 receipts.

ROUTE.  Full-space exact evolution on every geometry.  Route A: Chebyshev expansion
of exp(-iHt) with a rigorous Bessel tail bound.  Route B: scaling-and-marching Taylor
with a rigorous factorial remainder bound (algorithmically disjoint from A -- no
Bessel coefficients, no three-term recurrence).  Route C: exact dense
eigendecomposition where n <= 12.  Every claim-grade cell is computed twice on route
A in-process and the observable-table digests compared byte-for-byte.

REDUCED SPECTRA.  Long arms make the naive conditional-mutual-information route
infeasible (for a degree-2 spider the joint of both fragments with the pointer is the
WHOLE system, so the pinned code path would need a 2^15 x 2^15 matrix).  This block
therefore carries TWO exact routes to the same spectrum: the pinned DIRECT route
(materialise the reduced density matrix, eigvalsh) wherever its dimension is at most
DIRECT_MAX_DIM, and a GRAM route (the nonzero spectrum of M M^dag equals that of the
smaller Gram matrix M^dag M) everywhere.  The two are algebraically identical; the
runner cross-validates them on every cell where both are feasible and reports the
maximum deviation.  Every pinned 917/919/921 cell falls inside the direct route, so
the value-for-value gates run on the pinned code path unchanged.

Deterministic, float64/complex128, no network, no tree writes outside the declared
receipt.
