"""Cycle 946 -- THE MIRROR-PARTNERED KERNEL, and the first post-adoption derivation.

TWO INPUTS.

(A) Cycle 943 localised the branch divergence of the choice substrate to EIGHT
    of 5,815 wires, SIX of them mirror-paired and exactly swap-related, and
    named the sole obstruction: the record cell's ORIENTATION field, the one
    record datum with no mirror partner.  Its named successor -- the whole
    point of this block -- was "give the orientation field a mirror partner".

(B) The owner adopted a revised Admissibility axiom on 2026-08-05 (PR #6011,
    branch axioms/admissibility-likelihood-20260805).  Its second sentence
    reads, byte for byte:

        For each site, the probability distribution over the possibilities is
        determined by, and varies with, the nearest-neighbor conditions.

    EVERY CLAIM IN THIS BLOCK THAT CONSUMES THAT TEXT IS CONDITIONAL ON #6011
    LANDING.  The branch's file is vendor-read by `git show` and pinned by
    sha256 AND git blob; the worktree's own (pre-adoption) axiom memo is pinned
    separately so the delta is on the record.

WHAT THIS BLOCK BUILDS.  The minimal splice-only modification of 936's choice
substrate that repairs the mirror defect: for the involution

    sigma = swap(LEFT_ENDPOINT, RIGHT_ENDPOINT)
            o  swap(BANK_i.U_TO_V, BANK_i.V_TO_U)  for every one of the 12 banks

the compiled law's gate multiset is NOT sigma-invariant.  Its ENTIRE defect is
TWELVE distinct gates (220 occurrences of 34,188).  The partnered kernel is
L_ext = L union sigma(L): each deficit occurrence keeps its place and its
sigma-image is inserted immediately after it.  Nothing is deleted, reordered or
edited; the pinned compiler and the pinned emitter are untouched.

WHAT IT FINDS.  In the partnered kernel sigma is an exact automorphism of the
law (gate multiset sigma-invariant on every station; 940's own colour
refinement now gives LEFT and RIGHT the SAME colour under every label, where in
the unpartnered kernel it separated them under every label; semantic
commutation on a large random ensemble has zero breaking wires against 139 for
the unpartnered kernel).  The orientation wires 202/236 vanish from every
branch-divergence support.  At 3 of the 5 genuine two-item menu sites the
lane-restricted swap exchanges the branches exactly, over the whole declared
window.  At the other 2 the PRE-CHOICE CONDITIONS THEMSELVES differ under the
swap -- and the adopted axiom's "varies with" clause then correctly declines to
force anything.

THE FIREWALL, AS MODIFIED FOR THIS BLOCK.  Derived CONDITIONAL values ARE the
deliverable.  No unconditional weight value may be output.  Every numeric
weight sits under a key path containing CONDITIONAL, HYPOTHETICAL, IF_ or
THEOREM.  Zero float literals; exact rationals end to end.

MINIMAL-PREMISE RULE.  943's symmetriser sketch and the supervisor's two
derivation routes are NOT premises.  943's sketch is REFUTED AS STATED and
repaired: mirror-partnering the orientation field ALONE does not make the swap
a law symmetry (an eight-gate link-ladder defect remains, which 943 never saw
because it only ever looked inside the divergence support).  The covariance
route is REJECTED on the axiom's own bytes; the neighborhood-equality route
carries the theorem.

    LEFT/RIGHT is forced: on the menu the endpoint content is the two

    is exactly EXCHANGING the two menu items -- and, on the menu only, is also
    exactly flipping both bits (943's chi).  The wire-exchange reading is the
    one used here because it is a RELABELLING, so it conjugates gates without
    touching values, which is what makes an exact automorphism statement
    available at all.

    The bank rails U_TO_V / V_TO_U are forced too: they are the wires the
    endpoint pair drives (the source-pointer TOF quartet), and 943 measured
    them mirror-paired.  All twelve banks are included, not just the two the
    divergence support happens to reach: a LAW symmetry is a statement about
    every state, so a defect on a bank the declared orbit never excites is
    still a defect.  Including all twelve costs nothing (the extra ten banks
    turn out to carry ZERO defect) and closes an off-orbit hole."""

            "The whole mirror defect of the 34,188-gate choice substrate "
            "under the menu swap is TWELVE distinct gates: four orientation "
            "drives (943's named repair, found here in both banks and both "
            "cells) and an eight-gate cross-bank link ladder 943 never saw "
            "because it only ever looked inside the divergence support -- so "
            "943's sketch is confirmed in its first clause and REFUTED in its "
            "second.  Splicing the 220 missing mirror images makes the swap "
            "an exact automorphism of the law: 940's own colour refinement, "
            "which separates LEFT from RIGHT under every label in the "
            "unpartnered kernel, gives them the SAME colour here, and "
            "semantic commutation has zero breaking wires against 139.  The "
            "orientation wires vanish from every branch-divergence support.  "
            "At 3 of the 5 genuine two-item menu sites the swap exchanges the "
            "branches over the whole declared window; at the other 2 the "
            "pre-choice conditions themselves differ under the swap, and the "
            "adopted axiom's 'varies with' clause correctly declines to fix "
            "them.  CONDITIONAL ON PR #6011 LANDING, the adopted "
            "Admissibility text plus Qubit's no-privilege clause then force "
            "equal weights at exactly the covered sites -- the first place "
            "this framework DERIVES the two-item value rather than "
            "registering it.  The covariance route is rejected on the axiom's "
            "own bytes; the neighborhood-equality route carries the theorem.  "
            "The price is real and is posted: the partnered kernel is a "
            "different kernel, its record loses discrimination, and the "

            "axiom, it DERIVES the symmetric two-item weight at the sites "

            "and 3 of 5 genuine menus, not all; the general form of the "
            "distribution is untouched; nothing transports to the "
