"""Checks for an auxiliary-face local realization of a plaquette measure.

For a strictly positive finite cyclic plaquette weight T and any
0 < epsilon < min(T), a face auxiliary has one universal state plus one state
for each ordered boundary-link tuple.  Its local factor is epsilon in the
universal state, T(curl)-epsilon for the matching tuple, and zero otherwise.
Summing the face auxiliary returns T(curl) exactly.  The universal state also
connects the support under single-site full-conditional moves.
